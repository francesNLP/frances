## Important

Place here chapbooks_metadata_pages.yml or any of the results files obtained from running [write_metadata_pages_yml](https://github.com/francesNLP/defoe/blob/master/defoe/nls/queries/write_metadata_pages_yml) query.

In this folder, your Knowlege Graph will be created after running:

1. Metadata_Pages_NLS.ipynb --> it will create a dataframe (from your defoe result file) and store it here.
2. Dataframe2RDF.ipynb -> it will create a knowlege graph (from the previous dataframe file) and store it here.
