It is not till the distinction has been appreciated between nature as it is and nature as we make it to be, between that which we see and that which ' having not seen, we love,' that any branch of art can be reckoned in its proper value.\" The writer of these remarks then goes on to contrast the matter-of-fact aspect of the source of our knowledge with the aspect of philosophy, art, and religion. The former takes our knowledge to be exclusively the result of the action of human thought; the latter admits the co-operation of nature by the transmission of images. The view of art, taking its stand on this basis, involves the absolute fusion of thought and things. The habitual interpretation of natural events by the analogy of human design, is but an anticipation of, and a step towards, such a true conquest of nature. This habitual interpretation is a proof that, \" to the ordinary man, nature presents itself, not as something external, but, like a friend, as ' another liimself.'\" Pure emotion is the medium of the true conquest of nature thus daily anticipated. In it \" the experiences of life are held together, and the animal element is so fused with the spiritual as to form one organisation, through which the same impulse runs with unimpeded energy. Then man has made nature his own, by becoming a conscious partaker of the reason which animates him and it. The attainment of this consummation can only approach realisation through the operation of a power which can penetrate the whole man, and act on every moment of his life. But that power, which, in the form of religion, can make every meal a sacrament, and transform human passion into the likeness of divine love, is represented at a lower stage, not only by the unifying action of speculative philosophy, but by the combining force of art.\" Art, then, is the celebration of the union of man with nature. And he must be one with her, else whence those untold feelings of sympathy with her sublime moods, of yearning after her loveliness ? That only arouses our feeling, which has something akin to ourselves; we know this from our intercourse with our fellow-men ; we may know it too from our intercourse with nature. Those thoughts of the Oxford graduate present to our minds a philosophy, under the shadow of which we may 10\n",

But no one was to be seen, save here and there an old woman at her prayers. The choir was no Av filled with a dim religious hght of many colours, that tempered the gloom of the old carved oak with motley hues. Randall, on retracing his steps down the church, paused a little west of the lectern, in front of the choristers' seats. Casting his eye over the rich stall-work, he looked at the lofty main arch east of the choir, into which the organ seemed to soar on brazen wings. Gazing then upwards beyond the arch, he felt himself dwindling into awe-struck insignificance. The warm light upon the stalls greeted him like a cheering message as he again looked around him. He was weary in body and in mind; and reassuring himself with the thought that his friends had not yet arrived, he seated himself in one of the choristers' seats, to gaze more at leisure on the wonders around him. What he gazed ou in reality was the land of dreams. Randall, on re-entering the Cathedral from the cloisters, had not failed to observe, over the porch opposite to him, a canopied niche with an antique stone figure in it. This he had supposed to be the figure of Werburga, the patron saint of the Cathedral. He had observed it mechanically and unthirddngly ; yet it formed, notwithstanding, a link in the chain of his remembrances. And no sooner had he entered dreamland, than his figure came to join itself to that which was now the central image in his thoughts. He fancied he sa AV the figure of Werburga float down from her niche, and glide noiselessly up the nave till she stood in fr(jnt of him. The figure wore a long, almost colourless robe ; her hair hung in loose ringlets over her shoulders. With a face of unearthly paleness, and eyes full of spiritual meaning, she told him that this her Cathedral was the type of her own life. Oppressed by vain and worldly suitors, she had built herself round by the walls of monastic seclusion, and fled from those who would take no denial. And thus, in a pure and saintly life, in sounding religious houses, she had found the highest happiness. Her concluding words were distinct in Randall's mind when he awoke. \" Should anyone cross your path who is crafty and vain as Werbode my suitor was, do not stay to contend with him ; remember mv words ; withd)-aw.\" 100\n",

      "The Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine. 93 Randall was rudely awakened by a sensation that made him fancy he was falling over a precipice. On opening his eyes, he found himself thrown forward upon the reading-desk, and on standing up, discovered to his surprise that the seat was so constructed as to prevent the occupant from acquiring a habit of sleeping during service; it was movable, and as soon as the head bent forward the seat did likewise. He was glad that no one was present to witness his discomfiture; and the last word of the saint, \" Withdraw,\" which haunted him, seemed peculiarly applicable to his present situation. He reflected, however, that this was somewhat pusillanimous advice, sit only to be followed by a woman and a nun. He was even inclined to beheve that had St. Werburga met with a suitor more congenial than the crafty Werbode, she might not have been so willing to withdraw from the world, and the calendar might have boasted of one saint fewer than it possessed. Preparing now to leave the Cathedral, Randall was arrested by the sound of a voice talking. It seemed to come from the wall behind him. He looked in that direction, but an old arch which had been built up seemed to yield a double denial to the possibility of any sound penetrating it. Walking down to the north-west angle of the choir, he perceived where it joined the transept a small and ancient-looking portal. It was half open, and beyond the screen that stretched across the doorway he peeped into a email room. A row of white robes hanging along the wall, showed that this was the choristers' vestry. That it was also the music-room, was shown by the piles of music-books on the table opposite the door. Within the door, and half-hidden by the screen, was an ancient sedile of curious construction. Advancing cautiously and silently, Randall seated himself on the portion of the sedile which was hidden by the screen. Here, by bending his head forward so as to bring it into a line with the screen, he was able to see all the occupants of the chamber without being perceived by them. Six chorister boys in white surplices were seated on a bench at the further end of the room, while opposite to them, the side of her face towards Randall, stood a woman—the same he had seen in the bow-window. Was he, then, again so near her as even to hear her speak % Were these the features he had seen in his dream? It was like another dream; he dared hardly No. 3.—MARCH 1875. N 101\n",

Her attitude was noble and natural, as, with the same flowing garment and simple tresses, she stood, with one hand slightly raised, the other hanging gracefully at her side, her eyes gazing intently before her, her lips moving eloquently. She must have been speaking for some time already, yet Randall, by listening attentively, was able to conjecture that the Avords now pronounced with such clearness, and accompanied by such grace of manner, formed part of an improvised lecture on music. PROCLA. (To he continued.) i^\\u hit §r. i^isthfttdorf. To many in this country the tidings of Dr. Tischendorf's death came with something of the pang of a personal loss. Not only was the department of scholarship in which he laboured one that has an interest for all, but his own career was marked by a brilliance of achievement, which never suffered expectation to fail till, ere yet the end had been thought of, hope was checked by the knowledge, first that failure of health, and now that death had arrested the cunning hand and brain, till then unresting. Now we can but turn to the past, and sorrowfully count the gains that, as his, can be added to no more. But it is well to do so, not only that Ave may know the greatness gone from us, and gratefully appreciate what this man has done, but also that, giving him his due place in the line of biblical critics, we may understand what is the work he has left behind, and, so understanding, be ready to welcome those who after him shall carry it on further towards completion. The few pages that follow cannot indeed claim to do anything towards this end; they crave indulgence merely as a feeble attempt to contribute towards making generally known the history of a scholar whose labours were for the benefit of all. Few personal details can indeed be given. This, however, seems to be of the less consequence that Tischendorf's was one of those lives which, devoted to the pursuit of a single absorbing aim, derive all meaning and interest from that aim:—nay, he may be said to have had no life apart from the central purpose that gathered to itself all his 102\n"

Thorstein named him, and after a general salutation he sat down at the feet of Hertha. \" They gave little trouble,\" said Thorstein, who, like Sir Rainulf, was washing his hands; \" I could not get at more than two of them to wound.\" \" No,\" said Rainulf, speaking Norse, but, as they told me, with a French mixture, \" they never came well up to me either, only crowded up the way.

IT is now twelve years ago or more that we passed for the first time a winter in Edinburgh, fresh from a German provincial town, and with our minds well stored with the music given at its winter concerts. Had we then been asked to give a sketch of the Edinburgh Musical Season, the task Avould have been far easier than now, when, on our retiirn to this town, we remark an extraordinary progress in all matters relating to the \" ideal art which underlies the rest.\" Some German friends were here at that earlier time, and it is much to say that the romantic halo, compiled of Scott's Novels, Queen Mary's History, and Mendelssohn's Tsles of Finga J, tlirough which they had viewed all things Scotch, suffered no serious diminution through contact with reality. However, as regards our music, they were critical, not to say heretical. \" You told us this was a musical country,\" they used to say reproachfully ; \" there seems to be only untutored melody, never sung in harmony by the people as with us; and if in chorus, with only the variations produced by half the voices being flat. Some of the airs are pretty, but you do not surely ground an assertion that the nation is musical on the raw material, the simple national songs found in many, especially mountainous countries; as the Swiss ' Jodel' songs, or the Tyrolese melodies, or the Muleteer Songs of Spain, which belong to nations who have done next to nothing in musical art. Your songs have certainly brightness of colour and a charmingly characteristic rhythm, and last and chiefly, capital words whether tender, humorous, or martial; words that no doubt have preserved you from the miserable vulgar trash in vogue among the English populace, who seem chiefly to enjoy a debased form of comic song; and yet,\" these misbelievers would continue, \" music has been cultivated as an art in England as never in Scotland; there is a school of good aiid characteristic English Church music; and the English Madrigals are as delightful as original in style, only for some inscrutable reason the English people no longer sing them.\" Any good Scotswomen may supply our indignant defence of the general superiority of Scotland, and our strong assertion that there was, as we do thoroughly No. 5.—MAT 1S7S.

In the first Cupid pleads with ardour; Venus has not much to say. She is subdued, and in truth far from beaiitiful. At the Thunderer's right hand sit Neptune and Pluto, Juno at his left; Diana, crescent-crowned, and Minerv^a, bend forward behind him. Before him are grouped Mars, Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Vulcan, Janus, and two river gods, and behind these Mercury gives the immortality-coijferring ambrosia into the hands of Psyche, round whose knees an Amor throws his little arms. The gravity and brooding solemnity of this council chamber in the cloiids is strongly contrasted with the jollity and mirth, the flash of wit, and the throb of song of the marriage feast, where Psyche sits encircled by Cupid's arm, gazing into his gazing eyes, and anointed by the Graces. The kindly gods and goddesses round the table make jovial mirth among themselves, and do not annoy the lovers with their eyes (though Jupiter does look as if he had sometliing to do to keep away his !) Pan and the I Muses sing and dance, and the butterfly (or, if I must speak the truth, battledore) winged sylphs scatter flowers upon the festive board. One of these is an old friend, though he is better off for wings when he waits upon Mary of the Flowers.^ And now we will turn to the Amorini, which are seen under the Gothic arches of flo Avers above the windows. The exulting boys revel in their heaven of blue. Here, disdaining the enraged eagle, one flies off Avith Jupiter's thunderbolts; Avdiile there, another, pursued by sea-gulls and stormy petrels, absconds Avith Neptune's trident.

There, follo Aved by lia Avks, one goes Avith the shield and S Avord of Mars ; and the griifin dismays not another as he robs Diana of her bow and quiver.

      "The Ladles Edinburgh Magazine. 81 foam of the waves spreads white and vapoury over the surface of the sharp jagged rocks, on which swoop do Avn hungry and screaming cormorants—sit accompaniments of this desolate spot. It is a most powerfully painted picture, and overwhelms the spectator with a sense of the majesty and grandeur of nature in her stormiest aspects. Great Room, No. 177—\" Christ and Mary at the Sepulchre,\" by Sir Noel Paton. We have before now, we think, expressed the opinion that this is not the age for such a subject as this painting endeavours to realise. Our modern painters lack the unquestioning faith, the sure conviction, that gave to the Old Masters not only the imagination to conceive, but the realising hand to perform. The Saviour was to them a man who walked the earth as they did themselves, and His mother a simple-minded Israelitish woman, and they painted them as such; they endeavoured also to embody something beyond and yet within these realistic men and women— whether they succeeded or not, it is left for posterity to judge. But what is this scene before us ? What does it represent ? Certainly not the event as described in Holy A Vrit; and we do think that Sir Noel Paton's fancy plays more naturally and easily around fairy-land and folklore, than about such exalted subjects as the one before us. We now hasten on to No. 224—\" Cleopatra,\" by Alma Tadema. Here indeed is tlie hand of genius in this wonderfvil specimen of a master's art. In the pose of the head and shoulders, in the living expression of the eye, in the varying flesh-tints of throat and bust, in the sensuous and powerful organism, we recognise the dark Egyptian Queen who enthralled in her toils an Antony and a Caesar. No. 234, by W. j\\I'Taggart, is a fine picture, excellently conceived and painted. The force of the gale driving the boat through the liissing sea, is in fine contrast to the calm courage of the men within, who are holding their own in the midst of the stormy sea, and have the boat in steady keeping. The broad expanse of angry waves in the middle distance, with the fleet of fisliing-boats in the perspective, are truthfully rendered; while the general tone and colour of the scene are in fine keeping. Mr. M'Taggart has also, in No. 200—\" The Fern Gatherers,\" a very charming bit of colour. We have rarely seen a prettier or brighter child's face than the little girl who is looking out upon us in the foreground of the picture.\n",

MY DEAR FRIEND,—It has been said that the past and the future often seem more real to us than the present. This of course does not apply to all natures equally, and must greatly depend on the relative degrees in which memory, imagination, and hope prevail in the character. The healthiest state of mind, no doubt, is that which, Avhile it cherishes tender recollections of the past and cheerful hope for the future, has yet that wholesome consciousness of the present which gives its true tone to life and life's 'work. Yet as one grows older, and as advancing years Avithdraw us from more active pursuits, how often do \" the sessions of sweet silent thought \" summon back much that is interesting to ourselves personally; and in as far as possessing a connection with characters and events of any note, may be interesting to others.

Only our northern Avomen would thank you little for such songs; they will do for the ladies of the south.\" But Astolfo sprang up displeased, sajang he would suffer no such songs from the chaplain of Valeria's castle, and so with her and her maidens he went away. It was midnight ere Damasus rose and went also, and soon after 1 was startled by a shriek, and hard on it a fall against the door. I opened it, and Damasus staggered in and clung to me. Not a word could he say but \" The monk, the monk !\" till he recovered a little as I gave him wine; but still he would answer none of my questions. I had to lead him back to his room and get a man-at-arms to stay there with him ere he could be pacified, and I could return to the hall, where I sat awhile alone dreaming over the fire. I had fallen asleep, when I know not what awoke me suddenly : the lamp was out and the fire too, all but one red brand. I sprang up, and crossed the dark hall to the great door which led on to the staircase, where was my room. I felt for this door, and at last found and opened it, and then stopped, for on the great staircase was a tall dark figure, all cowled or veiled. There was a kind of flicker aboiit it, and most strangely was it all—was the one hand which was uplifted—edged with the sort of cold blue-fire that at times seems to burn in the sea. What could the horror be ? the ghost of one escaped from the cold prison-halls of Ean, the blue depths of the sea— Swend or Lorenzo? But even as I strove to ask the Appearance what it was, it was gone. Just then a yellow glimmer showed far down the corridor; two armed men were hurrying up, Italians of our garrison, and iii their hands were drawn daggers. \" How if he resists ? \" said one to another; \" these Northmen are strong.\" \" Silence the bird's song for ever,\" laughed the other, as they disappeared into my room. I felt for my weapon, for these were earthly foes; and soon they came oiit, speaking of searching in the hall. Then with a sudden cry, \" The monk—Fra Lucio—Holy Mary to our aid! \" they fled clattering down the passage whence they had come. Then went I to my room, and taking thence helmet, brynie, and trusty sword, felt nerved again, and crossed the hall to seek Hertha. But in the passage beyond, there already was Hertha coming to find me ; behind her, like a rough faithful dog, walked Olver, and Ivar also, No. 1.—JASUART 1876. B\n",

Lady Mary Lascelles, but mamma wishes to go with me herself, and I wish it too ; and he is so anxious about my dress and the rest of it, that I am quite tired of all the fuss.\" \" I wish I could have seen you dressed for your first ball,\" I sighed. \" So you shall; I'll stop the carriage and come in as we drive past, and you can think of me dancing and coquetting all evening, and shocking Cousin Robert horribly.\" Mr. Lyttleton came, but I at least did not appreciate him on further acquaintance, nor, to judge by his manner, did 1 stand much higher in his opinion than formerly. Naturally I saw less of Nita when he was at the Manor House ; when I did, there was a shadow of trouble on her eunny face, and she was doubly kind in her manner, as if to make up for what I was suffering at the hands of her cousin in my absence. I saw them often together on the river and in the woods, and I saw that this self-contained man had given all his heart, such as it was, to the young creature beside him. The knowledge of it stung me so cruelly to the quick that it forced on me the reluctant consciousness that what I had considered solicitude for her happiness was the caring for my own, and I told myself that the \" little one \" had grown dearer to me than life itself, and that the very hopelessness of possessing her made the burden of my enforced loneliness more bitter to bear. The evening of the ball was a sharp, clear, frosty night. 1 had moved to the room which fronted the road down which the Leslies must drive on their way to Aston. Lost in thought, I started to hear the sudden jerking of horses brought to a standstill close beside me, and a voice demanding impatiently the reason of the delay. \" I am getting out a moment here,\" said Nita's gentle voice. \"1 shall not detain you a minute.\" \" For what, pray'? \" demanded Mr. Lyttleton. \" I promised ages ago that Arthur should see me dressed for my first ball,\" she replied hghtly. _ \"Nonsense, Nita I If you have no notion of what's right and proper yourself, surely, Mrs. Leslie, you will not allow her to go, besides spoiling her dress getting out\n",

      "Silent Friends. 59 speaks, a healing balsam pours itself into my wounds, and I am at peace. I am no longer in my lonely chamber, the intense glow, deepening into the shimmering haze on purple hills of an Eastern sky, is before me, the silvery green of olive groves softens the outline of the rugged rocks which enclose a valley where lies a little village. As I near it, the rise and fall of Oriental lamentation for the dead breaks upon my ears; I stand, where two sisters, different as night from day, but now alike in the unity of one common grief, lament with bitter wailing the loss of their brotlier, their bread-winner, the head .of their once happy household. I am weeping now, not for my own loss, but for theirs : I am comforted too, not by any earthly friends, but because the same tears which mingled with Martha's and Mary's were shed for me as Avell. This is what my gentle friend has told me in the twilight. But once more. Circumstances have placed me in a remote part of a wide and thinly populated continent. Human companionship is denied me, except at rare and most welcome intervals. Hard manual labour, to till my ground and make myself a habitation, distracts me for a time; but looking at dark days in the past and for better days in the future gets wearisome at last. What should I do but for two or three of those \" silent ones\" who have accompanied me across the seas ? So often have I heard them that I know every word they are going to say, yet now they fall on my ear with an accent like a voice of home! and the scent which lingers on their garments has a whiff of the sweetbriar and wallflower of the garden of my childhood. They have an honoured place in my wretched hut; I patch and mend their tattered clothes, while my own go threadbare. Do wanderers come to my home and break the monotony of uncounted weeks ? I introduce them to my dumb companions, so that they may share in my delight. And when brighter days come, and 1 have again a place in my own country, and gather other of the silent brotherhood around me, younger, more brilliant, and cleverer than these, their old and worn faces shall still have the first place in my affections, so sanctified are they by use and memory.

Is it so with thee. Marquis? Canst thou lead us where we may aid Thorstein ? he forbade us to follow him.\" Now the vault to unwarned men was but a trap, nor could I control myself to guide them. Then suddenly I thought if they could cut through the water-channel and lay the vaults under water before Thorstein came, he might yet be saved ; and I pointed at the narrow barrier. *' Ah, this is new,\" said Astolfo ; \" shall we cut it through then, Renzo ?\" and as I signed assent, Kolbiorn with his axe, and Astolfo with his sword, began to work on it ; and they afterwards said that I seemed to vanish away, but the spell of my evil errand came over me, and I fled away into the thick mist, forced to meet Thorstein, who now came riding at a distance over the marsh-lands. As he saw me he dismounted, and silently I led the way to where the low bushes concealed the entrance to the vaults. I raised them, the portal was open, and Thorstein stepped into the darkness with his sword drawn, and then paused as a sudden rush and roar of waters came to our ears. And then came out on the hot stimmer night such a blast of cold wind, fetid and poisonous, as bore us both back from the mouth of the cavern. It was the soul air rising before the rising Avaters. Then came a sound like thunder within the clifi\", and a broad sheet of flame flashed for a moment from the dark doorway and vanished in the night; but in its light I could see several dark figures rushing forth from the vault.

Let us now proceed to look a little more closely at tliis strangely varied life. There was nothing in Mrs Inchbald's birth or station to hint at the position she was destined to hold. Tlie child of John and Mary Simpson, who were farmers and Catholics at Standing-field, near Bury St Edmunds, Elizabeth Simpson was born on the 15th October 1753. She had three sisters, who, like herself, were all remarkable for great beauty. Elizabeth was of an ardent and romantic nature, and was early seized with a longing to see the world; at the age of thirteen, this desire seems to have reached its climax, for she then declared that \" she would rather die than live any longer without seeing the world.\" A visit to the theatre at Bury St Edmunds only increased this longing, and when about sixteen she applied by letter to the manager of the Norwicli theatre for an engagement. When we remember that she was not only quite untrained, but laboured under a defect in her utterance, it is not surprising that these overtures were rejected. She seems, however, to have had a romantic and girlish tendre for this manager, as his name, Eichard Griffith, printed in large letters at the end of her year's pocket-book, may testify. Education in tlie Simpson family appears to have been confined to evening readings, and those chiefly of a theatrical nature. Elizabeth, both at this period and later, was almost entirely self-educated. In her voluminous diaries, we often find the records of her readings during a whole year. These, in the year 1783, when she was twenty years of age, comprised Rollin's Ancient History, those of Greece and Eome, England and Ireland; The Pantheon, as a guide to tlie translation of Homer's Odyssey; Tasso, Paradise Lost and Regained, Junius' Letters, Hume's Essays, Letters of Voltaire, and Essays upon Shakspere; besides many of the classics in the best translations. At a later period, we find her reading Gibbon's Life, Lord Chesterfle Ms Letters, Phctarch's Lives, &c. In 1782, she made careful researches in the History of England, \" studied a work on the globes, and entered carefully in her common place book the distances, bulk, and other characteristics of the heavenly bodies.\" She also applied herself to natural philosophy, and\n",

      "228 T Jie Ladies Edinburgh Magazine. STEAY NOTES. THE Edinburgh University Local Examinations have created considerable stir tlirougliout Scotland this year. There were no fewer than twenty-four Centres needed to satisfy the demands of candidates in various parts of the country, including two Centres in England, viz. :—London and Peterborough. This is an advance of thirteen on the number of Centres formed last year. Altogether, these Examinations seem to be taking a firm hold in Scotland, and to their power we look for great improvement in the general education of the country. IN our May number, we asked why no one had followed the example of Cambridge in offering a prize of .£10 or of £\\h for excellence in Special Subjects. We are happy to announce that this query has not been in vain. A \" constant reader\" has been moved to offer i,'10 as a prize for excellence in Latin at the Local Examinations of June 1878. WE learn with great pleasure that a Ladies' Educational Association is now formed in Aberdeen. A public meeting, attended by many influential citizens, was held on 11th Jvme, for the formation of this Association. Its aims are sound, and are summed uj) under the three following heads :—1. To establish Advanced Classes for young ladies, to be conducted chiefly by Professors in the University of Aberdeen. 2. To promote the extension to this district of the system of Local University Examinations. 3. To aid generally in promoting the Higher Education of Women. We wish this new association very great success. WE cannot allow the announcement of the death of Miss Mary Carpenter to pass without notice. The life-labours of so earnest and so indefatigable a worker can be but slightly comprehended by the many who are ignorant of the extent of her zeal and efforts ; but even to such her name will be ever associated with the benevolent reforms which have been brought to bear iipon the young waiss and strays of this land. While we honour her for the self-devotion with which she carried out her great aims, let us not forget that as a woman her character showed other evidence of depth of feeling, and of culture ; and assuredly her work among the neglected and erring lower classes of society was such as must be carried out, if the higher education, now so vigorously promoted, is to be more than a superficial toi:)-dressing. LADIES are invited to contribute to this Magazine. A PRIZE is offered for the best article received by the Editors and accepted for insertion during the current year, on any one of our British Female Novelists born in the 18th century. AT the next meeting of the Ladies' Edinburgh Literary Society, to be held on Saturday, July 7th, at 5 Chester Street, at 11 o'clock, instead of a formal debate, each member present will give a short description and criticism, original or quoted, of any picture whicli she has seen.

Lady Emily's consolations are characteristic. \" ' In my situation,' sobs Mary, ' what would you have done ?' ' Done! why, taken the old woman by the shoulder, and cried Boh ! in her ear.

The Inheritance appeared in 1824, with a better-laid plot and more sustained interest than the former work. The pompous Earl of Eossville is thus described :— \" He possessed a wide range for his unwearying powers in his own family; for he could weary his steward, and his housekeeper, and his gamekeeper, and liis coachman, and his groom, and his gardener, all the hours of the day, by perpetual fault-finding and directing; he deemed it his bounden duty to direct and manage every man, woman, child, or animal who came within his sphere, and that too in the most tedious and tormenting manner.\" As a soil to this gem, we have his cousin and bugbear, Miss Pratt. \" Everybody wearied of her, and everybody abused her;\n",

Unthinking friends sometimes pained him sadly, by giving him the catch-word abruptly. I noticed the delicacy of Miss Eerrier on these occasions. Her sight was bad, and she took care not to use her glasses when he was speaking, and she affected also to be troubled with deafness, and would say—' Well, I am getting as dull as a post; I have not heard a word since you said so-and-so, being sure to mention a circumstance behind that at which he had really halted. He then took up the thread with his habitual smile of courtesy, as if forgetting his case entirely in the consideration of the lady's infirmity.\" Such an instance of unselfish tact needs no connnent of ours.

In 1868, a single class of English Literature was held by Professor Masson. Tliis has been repeated every winter since, but always accompanied by other classes, M-hich have now come to number as many as six. Mrs Crudelius strongly desired raduation for women ; but discerning, with her usual good sense, the impossibility of obtaining this at once, she acquiesced in tlie best arrangement that could be made, and accepted the existing certificate. Incorporation with the University remained to the last her aim, and, while that was not granted, it seemed to her a matter of comparatively small importance whether or not Professors in their individual capacity took part in the management of the Association. It is, however, a satisfaction to those who to the end looked on Mrs Crudelius as its natural leader, that last winter's reconstruction of the Association was in its details shaped according to her suggestions. In 1868, Mrs Crudelius accepted the post of Secretary, and during the greater part of the last ten years acted in that capacity. Nearly all the time, she suffered from illness in various forms; but against this she struggled bravely, and during the first year of the Association's existence, its affairs were practically conducted by her alone. Afterwards she became unable for this, and frequent compulsory absences from Edinburgh, as well as shattered health, forced her at last to give up the work in which her interest was centred. Still she was there to guide others by her clear insight and wise counsel. Now it is so no more ; and none feel so deeply as those who worked witli her, and thus learned to know the largeness of her views, the singleness of her aims, her courage and openness, her generosity, lowliness, and utter carelessness of self, how great was the value of her life—how irrepaiable the loss when she passed away from the scene of all earthly activity.

Our three ladies, however, jomed the \"Clydesdale\" at Tobermory, on Tuesday, the 3d of July. When one is in Mull, one is pretty well independent of the outer world; communication is slow and infrequent; and so, when they had resolved, there was no one to say them \" nay,\" no one to cast doubtful looks at the clouds and prophesy failure. A little hitch occurred about going to Tobermory. The horses were otherwise engaged, a boat was at command, but winds and waves are proverbially fickle, and the \" pull \" was long. However, on Tuesday, the wind was all that could be desired, and with a full sail and a round sea, as one of the boatmen expressed it, they ran into Tobermory Bay—beautiful beyond even Oban or Portree. The day was not perfect, angry looking clouds were slitting about, and there was one very heavy shower in going to Tobermory ; but they took courage, and telegraphed to Broadford to have ponies waiting at Coruisk next day. Two of the party had already visited Skye; to the third, who had only seen the outline of its hills from a far distance, it had ever seemed more a dream and a romance than a reality. She was a little bit of a Jacobite, not very dangerous in these days. In her early youth she had done violent battle for Queen Mary's innocence and King Charles' honour. She had believed in the nobleness of the cavalier and the chivalry of Prince Charles. If some of her feelings are less strong than in her school-girl days, yet enough of the dream remains to invest Skye with the charm of a living romance ; besides, a hundred other recollections hover around it, and nature is to her the object of the deepest reverence and love. She wistfully looked at the sky, and hoped almost against hope. The journey was disappointing, as drenching rains came at short intervals; but, when it was fine, who shall venture to describe its fineness ? Tlie colouring, when tlie clouds rolled back, was rich in proportion as the darkness had been dark before.

Then it will come forth into the world, and set all the men a-crowing and talking over their old nonsense (with more show of reason, however) about the superiority of the sex. What a fine job the transcriber of my letters will have ! I hope the booksellers of those days w Ul be liberal, and allow the poor man a good price for his trouble.\" So writes Mary Eussell Mitford, at the age of twenty-five, to her friend Sir William Elford, with a true, albeit somewhat sarcastic, prediction of her posthumous same. The voluminous and illegible letters have been given to the world, the life has been written, the productions of her patient and painstaking pen are ranged as classics in our libraries, and pictures of herself and her home adorn the volumes. Although her works have now-a-days retired, as it were, from public life, to make way for their modern successors and competitors in the fields of literature, it is yet a task alike of interest and of pleasure to turn back for awhile to renew and to strengthen our acquaintance with one who holds a place of acknowledged eminence among British female writers of fiction. The father of Miss Mitford belonged to an ancient Northumbrian family. He graduated as physician at Edinburgh, obtained the hand of Miss Eussell, daughter of a Hampshire gentleman of good family, the only surviving heiress of a considerable fortune, and settled at Alresford, with the intention of practising his profession. There Mary was bom, the only and idolized child of her parents; and there she spent ten years of a happy childhood, in a charming home. But, in 1795, the family were obliged to leave this No. 36.-DECEMBER 1877. 2 Z\n",

The first move was to Lyme Eegis; and now, at the very beginning of their misfortunes, it seemed as if a turn had occurred in their favour. The little daughter became the possessor of a lottery ticket for £20,000, having determinedly adhered,in spiteof some slight difficulties, to her choice of what proved to be a winning number. Under these unexpected circumstances, Dr Mitford established his family at Eeading, and from thence Mary was sent to school in London, in 1798. Her letters and her conduct at this time bear witness to a precocity and strength of intellect quite unusual. She returned to the paternal roof in 1806, and in the autumn of that year her father took her to the north of England to visit his friends and connections there—a tour which her letters describe in detail with great vivacity. The pleasure of it was marred by a \" thoughtless and selfish vagary of her father's—his deserting her for an electioneering freak,\" and leaving this young girl, of barely twenty, without warning, to the care of her newly-formed acquaintances. After some interval, however, he rejoined her, and they returned to the south together towards the end of the year. Ere long, notwithstanding the windfall, the extravagance of his mode of life began to tell. The showy house he had built at Reading, on the site of a picturesque old farmhouse, had to be quitted, and the broken fortunes of the family found shelter in a wayside cottage at Three Mile Cross, not far from the town. This was Miss Mitford's home till within a few years of her death. Here her mother died in 1829. Nothing is more touching than the terms in which the daughter speaks of the loss of that dear parent —\" dear saint,\" as she calls her again and again in her letters. From this small and humble home—\" I seem to fill it,\" she writes—emanated nearly all the literary work of Miss Mitford's life. Here she wrote her stories, her dramas, and her immense correspondence—here she was visited by her many admirers—and here she devoted herself ceaselessly to the care of her father, till his death in 1842, at the advanced age of 82.

The wind is howling through the house, and a tree is creaking outside and beating its branches against the window in a way that has made me start and shiver many times. My old woman has long been gone to rest. I tried to keep her, to talk to, while she was taking away the tea things; but she was shy and laconic, and I could not get on with her. Good-night.

DEAREST HELEN,—I must now give you an account of my first day as Perpetual Curate of St. Saviour's, l Uingham, though I shall hardly know where to begin, or how to say enough to satisfy that craving of yours to 'know everything.' I cannot deny that my first impressions here have been far from exhilarating; perhaps the gloom of the weather may in part account for it, and the feeling of loneliness that I experience for the first time in my life. I slept little, and was up soon after six; came down and found old Mary was not about; took an umbrella and \\vent through the wind and rain to my church. My first feeling when I saw it was, that if I had seen church, house, and village for myself at the outset, instead of trusting to a friend's report, I should never have found myself in my present position. Few men, I should think, take their first glance of their parish when they actually come to reside; but I have done it, and must take the consequences. Well, I did not come here to find an easy life and enjoy the picturesque, but to do the work appointed me—God grant I may ! There was nobody about, and I did not know where the keys were kept, and thought it too early to go knocking at people's doors, so I contented myself with an outside survey.

The poetry was periphrastic in style,—i.e., giving the same ideas in various ways,—and it abounded in metaphor. For instance, we find the idea of crossing the sea expressed in four ways in one verse : ' Over rolling waters, over the ganet's bath, over the water's throng, over the whales' domain.' This school of poetry, already declining at the time of the Norman conquest, was almost forgotten for centuries.

Those who are interested in the higher education of women cannot but see cause for rejoicing in the issue of the convocation of the London University on Tuesday the loth January. By a majority of 110, the University was empowered to grant degrees to women in all the Faculties alike. Gentlemen who are interested in other Faculties besides the medical one, had ample opportunity of putting their veto upon the 'arrogant claims of ambitious women.' But the list of those in the minority has been found to consist chiefly of the names of medical men; and of such men there were even one or two who spoke in favour of the charter, and tried to combat the strong prejudice entertained against it by Sir William Jenner. The Daily News, a few days before, had some sensible remarks on the subject, thinking it highly desirable, for many reasons, that women should have an opportunity given them of showing what they can do. It deprecated the slipshod manner in which girls had been educated a few years ago, while their brothers were handed over to first-class teachers in the University, and concluded by showing how a woman's life in many instances offers more leisure for study than a man's. No residence is required in order to pass the examinations in this University, so that ladies may carry on their studies without any interruption of their domestic life. While the women of Britain can only praise that liberality of spirit which has supplied their education with such a perfect test, it remains for them to justifj' that liberality by showing that its ground of decision was not a mistaken one. C. B. thus answers A QUERIST.—Among the romances of last century, we name the Ladies of LlaiyoUen. About the year 17C5, the quiet Welsh folk were startled by the arrival of a couple of youths, who, like ' Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,' began building a picturesque but solid dwelling in the most retired corner of the lovely vale. No sooner was it completed, than, to the further amazement of the mountaineers, the boyish proprietors transformed themselves into elegant and accomplished women, being no other than Lady Eleanor Butler, of the noble house of Ormonde, and the Hon. Miss Ponsonby. Many were the surmises as to the reason of their flight from Ireland, and from their friends, to whom the proceedings and the retreat of the fair hermits remained for some little time a mystery.

We fear that her union was but an ill-assorted one, for we are told that Mary suffered from early unkindness, and she entertained in after life grateful recollections of the loving care of some aunts, her father's sisters, as having been very beneficial to her. It was, however, under her mother's tuition, and in remote Orkney, that she became a very fair musician, an excellent scholar in French and Italian; and having that turn for reading which conduces, more than any special talent in boy or girl, to the attainment of general cultivation, she grew up in her quiet home as sweet a specimen of intelligent, unaffected girlhood as one could wish to see. She was sent to school in Edinburgh for a short time, but seems to have had little or no systematic guidance in selfculture. Probably her friends were satisfied to see the girl ' fond of her book,' and left her to wander at her own sweet will in the realms of poetry and fiction. Training in the prosaic duties of life came to her early enough, for at sixteen she was called to the headship of her father's house, whether on account of Mrs. Balfour's ill-health or absence from home is not stated; and ' the details of housekeeping in Orkney are,' says the Memoir, ' of so exhausting a kind' as to leave her, during the next four years, with scant time for her favourite employments. But from what has been said of Mary Balfour's tastes, we may feel sure that intellectual recreation would sweeten homely toil. If she mended the household napery, knitted her brother's stockings, or sewed her seam with Shakspere or Milton lying open beside her, orturned her wheel to the rhythm of Petrarch's sonnets, or of some quaint old ballad, ' what for no ?' Or perhaps her fireside musings and lonely rambles on the shore of her island home were not wholly fancy free, and influenced her in a choice which was soon to be put before her. When she was about twenty, her godmother, Viscountess Wentworth, whose first husband had been Mrs. Balfour's brother. Lord Ligonier, was urgent that Mary should come and live with her in London. A dazzling prospect, surely, for the Orkney maiden, and one likely to allure any girl of her age. But an influence had come into Mary's life, how or when we are not told, which drew her powerfully in another direction. Like her mother before her, she turned her back on the gay\n",

Came back to breakfast, in which Mary had done her best for me; unpacked a box or two (for I found that some had preceded me here), and tried to make my room look a little less desolate. About eleven o'clock, a Mr. Grant, rector of a neighbouring parish, came over to induct me in due form ; so now there only remains to ' read in,' and I am fairly in possession. Mr. Grant went away directly his duties were over, and I began to take a leisurely survey of my churcli, accompanied by the old clerk. ' In excellent order, and in very good taste,' said our friend Mr. Villiers—good, easy man ! Now, Helen, hear! High pews with doors, cushioned mostly, but with nothing to kneel upon ; a gallery at the west end, where the choir performs to a bass fiddle; a ponderous reading-desk and high pulpit above it; a hideous wooden font in the centre of the church, slop-basin in it to hold the water—all this I saw at a glance, and my face, I fear, must have grown very long, while my poor old clerk showed off everything with conscious pride. The chancel is rather a redeeming feature. It has three well-shaped lancets, tolerable altar furniture, and is stalled. This must have been Villiers' ' good taste,' and he could have looked no farther. I am thankful, however, for some negative blessings. There are no great modern monuments, no squire's pew with curtains (that is in the other church), no bad stained glass. You shall paint the Commandments, as you promised, for the chancel; there is a reredos of stained wood and tolerable design, empty panels at present. I will send you the dimensions and other particulars next letter. After leaving the church, I explored my half of the village thoroughly, and learned the geography of the whole place. My clerk, who is a cobbler, went back to his work, and I made my observations alone. I should be ashamed to tell you how depressing they were to me. The place looked wofu Uy ugly, and had a strange lifelessness about it. Every one I addressed seemed cold and shy; not a woman curtsied or gave me good-day as I passed her door, though some turned to look at me inquisitively. I saw many public-houses, and three men passed me reeling drunk—two of them cursing and blaspheming. In the afternoon I went into my schools—good buildings, but blank and cold, like all else.

To some fraternal criticism, she makes answer that the great purpose of her writing at all is 'to procure admission for the religion of a sound mind, and of the Bible where it cannot find access in any other form.' In another letter, addressed also to her brother, she claims an exclusive property in this line of authorship, and, we think, with some justice. There are scores of tales now-a-days which seek to show the effect on character for good or ill, according to the governing principle, of the changes and chances of everyday life ; and Jane Austen is commonly pointed to as the founder of this school. Mary Brunton, we think, is much more the model which has been followed by many subsequent female writers, whether consciously or not. Her lesson is conveyed, as she herself remarks, with all the directness of Miss Edgeworth, —a writer in the same line, but at how much lower a level as to the moral she enforces. '\" Honesty is the best policy ;\" \" A penny saved is a penny got,\" ' as Mrs. Brunton says, ' seem the texts which she has embellished witli her shrewd observation and exquisite painting of character.' The heroine of Discipline is less interesting in herself than Laura Montreville, or else she seems so from the autobiographical form which the author has adopted. She does not meet with such extraordinary adventures as her predecessor; the worst is her temporary incarceration in a lunatic asylum, and that perhaps was not so utterly impossible in Mrs. Brunton's day as in our own. Ellen Percy's spoilt childhood is excellently described, and so is her career as a beautiful, wealthy, motherless girl, influenced occasionally for good by the counsel and holy character of a friend of her dead mother, but more often by a scheming and sycophantic companion of her own age. Her father's death, her own reverse of fortune, and the hard experiences consequent thereon, are the discipline which moulds Ellen into the happy wife whose felicity disturbed the slumbers of good Dr. Brunton. The beginning of the tale strikes us as the best, though the Highland part of it is evidently written con amore. She began to plan another story, Emmeline; but it is now, we believe, out of print, and we have only the rough outline, given in the Memoir, from which to judge of it. It made slow progress,—journeys, illness, social obligations, and, perhaps, a good deal of time spent over the fascinating pages of Guy Majinering, Tales of My Landlord, Boh Boy, etc., interfered with her own literary work.

' Her taste had not been very early cultivated, but it grew so rapidly with the slightest guidance that any defect was obviously the fault not of nature, but of misdirection. Her judgment was both quick and steady, and her discrimination between sophistry and sound argument was almost intuitive.' This conjugal criticism is not unduly favourable, but we have something of objection to add to it on the score of the disagreeable motif she has chosen for two out of her three tales, the last of which is unfinished. We do not say that such subjects ought to be altogether avoided by the novelist, or that there is anything to blame in the views expressed by our authoress, but there certainly is a freedom in dealing with the hopes and designs of a wdcked man which is objectionable to the greater refinement of the present day. That refinement may often be only external; and many a book coming from a lady's pen, lying on ladies' tables, and seen even in the hands of youthful readers, may be more really harmful by its suggestion or palliation of evil than Mrs. Brunton's plain-spoken pages ; but their being open to this criticism probably accounts in some degree for the early wane of their popularity. In extenuation of tliis fault, we must repeat that Mrs. Brunton never, so far as we remember, sails to draw a sound lesson from these unpleasing topics; and we must bear in mind that she lived not in the most refined circles, and in a plain-speaking generation, wliich called sins of all sorts by their own ugly names, and tliought Tom Jones and Clarissa Harlowe improving reading for young ladies. Had Mary Brunton lived to write more, and to profit by sound criticism, she would, we think, have won a high place among female novelists. A. D. Spring Song.

' Pity,' she said ; ' but Slade \\'.s stiff! You should have seen Mr. Miller in his best days—all young men loved him; he would have kept you straight if anybody could;' and with that she took her leave. Friday, 19ih.—Mother wants to know whether I am really comfortable in my household, and whether my old woman knows how to cook. Oh dear, yes ! only I wish she was not quite so fond of it. She has been in this very morning blowing me up because I don't have banquets on a Friday. ' Well, Mary, I don't interfere with your dinner; so surely you might leave mine alone.' \"Deed sir, an' I wad say nowt about it the day, if only ye wad eat what I send in of ither days; but mak' things as nice as I wull, ye'll hardly touch owt, an' I's sure I lie awake at neet thinking how I could contrive somethin' ye might fancy. I wur always reckoned a good han' at puddins, but 'deed here they mostly goes out as they comes in.' ' Indeed, Mary, your cooking is excellent, and I thrive upon it; but do go now, or I shall never finish my sermon;' on which she departed slightly offended. But you must not fancy the case is as she states; this is only a burst of professional zeal which I am sure Mamma will appreciate. I have seen Margaret Scott nearly every day, and think I am making way with her. She evidently looks with pleasure to my visits now; and I have got her to undertake a regular though simple course of reading. Her mind is so undisciplined that it must be line upon line, precept upon precept, with her. There is a confirmation coming on towards the autumn, which will give me much more work. I find it used to be the custom of old Mr. Miller and my predecessor to hold their classes all together in the large schoolroom of the old parish. I don't fancy Slade and I shall manage any such conjunction, but at all events the proposal must come from him, not from me. Saturday, 2Qth.—I have an invitation this morning from Mr. Villiers to stay with him the week after next, from Monday till Thursday. I accept with pleasure; I shall be so glad to see an old friend again, and there are a thousand things I wish to talk to him about.

My ground is pretty, and some large ash and sycamore trees in the field close by give it shade and snugness. When I have got it quite gay, I shall let all my people come and walk in it. The young girls shall gather the flowers, and the old women shall help themselves to pot herbs ; and so perhaps I may bring in a taste for gardening, which is greatly wanted. It is true they have always had the example of the rectory garden, which is beautiful, but then it has not been thrown open as mine is to be ! Satiorday, 27th.—I made my call on Slade yesterday, and found him in his study. Poor fellow, he was evidently getting up his extempore sermon, and I must have been a great interruption to his meditations; so that altogether I was not surprised at finding him a little more frosty than usual. Having shaken hands and given me a chair, he left me to open the proceedings; and I began to explain how completely I had been in ignorance of his arrangements when I began my cricketing. He bowed and seemed to wish to have no more said about it, but had not the air of believing me. After that, we talked about the confirmation classes, and fully agreed that we had better hold them quite independently of one another in our respective schoolrooms. I should like to have gone to see Mr. Miller, but Slade Avas evidently determined I should not, and gave out that he was too ill to see any one ; and so our interview came to an end. Good-night, dear Helen. I must take this volume of my memoirs with me to Conder Hall, in hopes of having something to make it more worth sending. Co NDEE, HALL, May 30th. Here I am in gay life and luxury again. Such a contrast to my grubby little den, and old Mary ' doing for' me ! Here I have a smart gentleman pottering after me at all hours of the day, and at my disposal I have horses, dogs, carriages, fishing-rods, billiard tables, and musical young ladies. Of all these luxuries, I have chosen a horse, and I have had a luad gallop over the moors this morning. Mr. Villiers is most kind, and it is a great enjoyment talking to one who knows all my own people, and takes a real genuine interest in all that concerns me. Another great good has befallen me here. I have made acquaintance with our archdeacon, who is one of the guests.

I remain,' etc. ' There !' I thought,' that, without showing any ill humour, will be a hint to him to discontinue his visits; and when he ceases to come, Mrs. Barron will soon be glad enough to see me again.' In the evening came this answer: ' Dear Sir,—I feel I owe you an explanation of the circumstances under which I ventured to visit one of your flock.' Then followed some of the details which you know; and then: ' It was at Mrs. Barren's urgent request that I went to see her niece. You were away; and I felt that the necessity of the case justified the step. I trust I have been enabled to be of use. If you desire it, my visits shall now cease, notwithstanding that both women appear to desire my further ministrations. I leave the matter entirely to your judgment and feeling, and remain,' etc. What a regular Slade note! And yet it is hard to say why it is disagreeable. It is calm, courteous, and reasonable, and yet, somehow, there is the old air of assuming to be always right. On Sunday evening I wrote one line to Margaret, and sent it by old Mary, desiring lier to give it to the girl herself. I said: ' Dear Margaret Scott,—I intend to call to-morrow after service, and beg that, if you are at all able to see any one, you will let me be admitted. I am truly sorry for your fresh troubles.—Yours, r. J. E.' Accordingly, yesterday morning I was shown up. Margaret lay dressed upon the bed. She looked a melancholy wreck, and turned on me the most piteous eyes as I entered. There was a great embarrassment in her manner, however, and she never looked me in the face again. I saw her trying to hide the tract she was reading, but I had seen its title, ' Have you found the Way ?' I took no notice of this, of course, nor of Slade's visits, but went direct to the subject of her new trials, on which I learned little more than I liave already told you; but I saw that poor Margaret had been within an inch of madness. The pitiless old wretch, it appears, still comes every day; and as she cannot get into the house, she stands and storms under the window, and the girl trembles at the very sound of her voice. While I was talking, Mrs. Barron came to the bedroom door, and, hearing voices, called out to her niece, ' Margot, is Mr. Slade there ? If he is, I'll not come in.' ' No, aunt, no; it's Mr. Eeynolds,' said poor Margaret, turning very red. On which I opened the door, and said, ' Pray come in, Mrs. Barron; we've nearly finished our talk.'

However, I don't wish you to enter into this,—I am glad you had him to turn to. What w'e have now to do is to consider how we can do the best for Margaret, and how we can prevent this person from molesting her any more.' Mrs. Barron broke in by asking me if I did not think it a hard thing that all this ' sash' should come to her door, when she had always tried to live quietly, and to make no talk, and had taken in her niece out of kindness, and now to find her the talk of the place ? And poor Margaret, in great distress, declared she would go away from l Uingham as soon as ever she could put foot to the ground again, and her aunt should never hear of her, nor be ' fashed' with her any more, at the same time owning her past kindness. I put a stop to all this as soon as I could, and took Mrs. Barron down-stairs. I think she thought I did not sympathize with her enough, or something put her out of humour, for she began to launch out into the praises of Slade. ' An' he did do Margot good, an' he did put up a beautiful prayer, extemporary, for her conversion—that did he. Howsumever, it hadn't pleased the Lord to answer it yet, for she was as benighted as ever, puir thing, and couldn't settle her mind to submit to the Lord's will ony way. An' would I be offended if Mr. Slade came again ?' ' Offended ! Certainly not, if Margaret wishes it.' ' She do wish it,' said Mrs. Barron; and I soon after took my leave, and wrote a line to Slade in answer to his, begging him to do as he thought best. I could have no objection to his visiting Margaret as a friend, though, of course, I did not intend to surrender my own charge of her. Evening.—I was surprised to-day by having a little girl shown in to speak to me. It was little Mary Winship, one of my old pets. She came to tell me that Grace was veryill, and wanted me to go and see her, and her mother had sent her to see if I would be so kind. Of course I went directly.

Indeed, I feel as if I were growing as fond of pen and ink as yourself, the reason I suppose being that I have ' nobody to speak to.' To begin, then, where I left off. On Thursday morning, as I was arranging my books, old Mary came in with a serious air, and, shutting the door carefully behind her, begged to know if I would please to allow her to speak to me. So I pleased, and with much circumlocution she got to her subject. It was, whether I was satisfied with her and would keep her on, and whether I would please look at her ' characters' that she had had from former places; and how, if I would not keep her, she must begin to look out for herself; and how, if I would keep her, she must have help, etc. I felt much cast down to think that housekeeping troubles were actually come upon me, and that I should have to do with wages, house books, and all the rest of it; however, there was no help for it. I laid down my books, got into my arm-chair, and resigned myself. Mary and I put our heads together, and the result of our cogitations is that now my household is organized. It was clearly proved to me that I must have a girl; and the plot must have been all cut and dried, for she had a girl ready to produce on the instant. Her niece ' Be U' arrived this morning, a most blooming lass. All the young women about here seem to be called Bell, only you must pronounce it Ba-11—that is, make a sound like the bleat of a young lamb and put an I after it. Besides Bell I have half a boy,—no, not half; I should say one-twelfth of a boy,—for a certain young Willie Hall (pronounce Woolley Harle) is to give us two hours of his valuable time every morning to clean shoes and knives. The next event yesterday was a call from the curate of the old church, Mr. Slade. He brought me the compliments of Mr. Mdler, the rector, and his excuses for not calling in person, on the score of ill-health. He is, I am told, quite confined to his sofa and has done nothing for years. Mr. Slade lives at the rectory with the old couple, and has, they say, everything his own way. I feel convinced somehow that this Mr. Slade and I shall not get on, either as fellowworkers or socially. In our first ten minutes' talk I found we were wide as the poles apart. The very sight of him repelled me. I rose to receive him warmly, being glad to see a man and a brother, but such a ' keep-your-distance' air as he made his bow with I never beheld.

With her poetic gifts was united a genius for music, particularly exercised in that rare art of ballad-singing so justly appreciated by our great lyrist Sir Walter; and the same of Miss Alderson's rendering of her own compositions is evident from her having had the honour of singing them to the Prince Eegent. Young, gay, and popular, she must have appeared a very charming creature on an eventful evening of her life, when among a small party impatient for her arrival was the unconscious arbiter of her destiny :— ' The evening was wearing away, and still she did not come. At length the door was flung open, and she entered bright and smiling, dressed in a robe of bine, her neck and arms bare, and on her head a small bonnet placed in somewhat coqnettish style, sideways, and snrmonnted by a plume of three white feathers. Her beautiful hair hung in rich waving tresses over her shoulders, her face was kindling with pleasure at sight of her old friends, and her whole appearance W Ms animated and glowing. At the time she came in, Opie was sitting on a sofa beside Mr. F., who had been saying from time to time, \" Amelia is coming ; Amelia will surely come. Why is she not here ? \" and whose eyes were turned in her direction. He was interrupted by his companion eagerly exclaiming, \" Who is that? who is that ?\" and hastily rising, he pressed forward to the fair object whose sudden appearance had so impressed him. He was evidently smitten, charmed at first sight, and, as she says, \"almost from my first arrival, Mr. Opie became my avowed lover.\" ' Such was Amelia Alderson as she captivated John Opie, whose ' love at first sight' proving as persistent as it was well founded, ultimately won its reward, and the young poetess gave her hand to the painter in Marylebone Church on 8th May 1798. Despite Allan Cunningham's remark in his J Ave^ of the Painters, that Opie ' looked like an inspired peasant,' and Mrs. Inchbald's allusion to a ' total absence of artificial manner as at once his adornment and deformity,' Mr. Opie's social popularity was great among large circles of learned and fashionable friends, to whom his wife did the honours of their house with the distinguishing tact and sweetness of manner of an accomplished hostess. A worshipper of his art, the zeal and diligence with which he worked drew the comment from his fellow-artist, Northcote, ' that while others painted to live, he lived to paint;' and incessantly engaged in his painting-room during daylight, he loved to spend his evenings in reading, conversing, or studying art with his wife, rather than in those gay scenes which attracted her, preferring, when he did go out, an opera or\n",

THANKS to my dearest mother and my Nelly for their letters; they are the sunshine of my life. If this letter goes as usual to Nelly, it is only to save mother's eyes; for I know Nelly will administer the contents (at discretion). You ask ' how I have been getting on all this long time ?' with a hint of a reproach in that last phrase! Well, my gardening is getting on beautifully, my singers are improving, my cricketing flourishes. For the rest, I am afraid I can only tell you of the usual round of parish cares. Dear little Grace Winship is dead. I buried her yesterday. I think her deathbed has been the happiest scene I have been present at since I came, and her funeral the most touching. Of course I only speak of herself, when I speak of the happiness; the grief of the mother was almost frantic, though hushed in her presence, and the little twin sister seemed bewildered and dazed with sorrow. If I spoke to her or took her little cold hand in mine, she could only look stupidly at me and say, ' Is Grace deein' ?—will she gan' awa' ?—will she really gan' ?' over and over again. But Grace herself, she looked like an angel; all pain had left her, and heaven seemed to have begun. I learned far more at her bedside than I liave ever taught. Neither the mother nor Mary came to the funeral. I begged them not, for I knew they could not hold up. All the school children came, and when the grave was filled up, a little hoy, who had been in a passion of tears all the time, could no longer contain himself, but came and threw himself upon it in an agony, and had at last to be carried away by force. He has been again to-day, crying and talking to himself on the grave. He is a neighbour's child, and the twins and he have been devoted to each other from infancy. I must now tell you the latest chapter in Margaret Scott's history.

The archdeacon was over here last week making a round of calls, half friendly, half ministerial. He came to my house of all others to ask for some luncheon ! What an inhospitable dog you will think me when I say that, with the exception of Jack Benson once or twice, and Walter once, he is the only person in my own rank of life who has eaten my bread since I came. I took it as a mark of exceeding favour that he should choose me; but of course old Mary is not accustomed to provide for august visitors, and I knew she would be wroth if at half-past twelve I sent orders for her to have luncheon for the archdeacon at a quarter-past one. Nevertheless I put a bold face upon it, and ringing for Bell, desired her to tell her aunt that such was to be the case. A few minutes after came a knock at the door, and I was summoned. ' Well, Mary ?' ' Well, sir, an' if ye please what am I to do ? There's no cold meat, for ye never will have a joint, an' all the scraps is gone into a pie for wersels.' ' Well, send in the pie and get yourselves something else.' ' Hout, sir, we've got wir dinner a'ready, an' there's little on it left, for Bill he has that big a appetite.' 'Well, it's gone; so that won't do. What was I to have for my dinner ?' 'I was gaun to the butcher's to get you a veal cutlet.' ' And it will take too long if you go out for anything? Let's see; do an omelette and some slices of bacon, and send in cheese and bread and butter.' ' Hout, sir, what's an omelette to set before an archdeacon, and him havin' ridden twenty mile this mornin' ? A fine notion he'll tak back 0' your housekeeping! But indeed I wish he did know how ye starve yoursel', for maybe he'd mak ye listen to reason. I'm forgetting a' my cookin' wi' just havin' nothin' to do.' ' Come, come, we've no time for that; go and do as I tell you.' So Mary went, looking very black; but when, a few minutes after the time, luncheon was announced, behold the cover was lifted up from a very handsome dish of beessteak ! I showed no surprise, but helped the archdeacon, who ate heartily and pronounced it excellent. Afterwards I learnt that Mary, even when she came to me and had her grumble, had already sent Bell out to the Anchor to borrmc whatever might be ' doing ' in the kitchen, with this happy result. Her summoning of me to council was only meant by way of a wholesome lesson ! The archdeacon came to see my church, did not quite like some of my arrangements, but was most kind in all he said.

Tuesday, Aug. 22. — I was interrupted the other day, and have never found time to go on. Tlie confirmation took place on Saturday at the old church. I am afraid I had' a movement of wicked vanity, for I could not help thinking how much nicer my little flock looked than Slade's, for all my girls were in white. I heard yesterday evening that Slade is going away for a fortnight at a moment's notice. I sent this morning what I meant for a kind note, asking if I could help him at all in the occasional week-day duty and so on; but there came back a note colder and shorter than all the old Slade-ite notes, merely announcing that he had provided against all emergencies. Strange, I thought, that he sliould go out of his way to seek more distant help when I am on the very spot. I was pondering on this, and on the cause of his violent and increasing prejudice against me, when a strange incident that occurred yesterday flashed into my mind, and seemed to throw a sudden light upon it. Let me tell it you, for your woman's wit will best judge if there is any connection. I was coming out of the house yesterday morning, when I met a carriage driving up to my door. Mrs. Wimpole put her head out, and said,' Mr. Eeynolds, are you at leisure ? for I have brought a young friend to lionize in Illingham. We want to see your church ; and then, if you can go witli us to see the view from Maldon Hill, which will look glorious to-day, we will put up the carriage and walk. Let me introduce you to Miss Aylmer.' ' My dear, this is Mr. Reynolds.' Then the young lady bent forward, and it was indeed no other than pretty Mary Aylmer, daughter of our friend the Q.C. We shook hands warmly, and Mrs. Wirapole appeared delighted. I was not at all at leisure, but of course I could do no less than offer to squire them about, as they had come on purpose. Mrs. Wimpole would, no doubt, at any other time have gone to her pet Slade ; but so soon after the rector's deatli, she would not think of disturbing him—so I went. We saw my church, and were on our way through the village to get to Maldon Hill, wlien Mrs. Wimpole stopped at a cottage and said she was going in to see an old servant of hers who was ill. ' And Mary dear, you won't mind taking a turn with Mr. Reynolds for a few minutes, as he's an old acquaintance.'

Then he looked upwards, and seemed to put violent constraint upon himself and was gone. I glanced at my companion; she was chatting on, only with a manner a little more distrait than before. Then Mrs. Wimpole came out, and we went to the hill. I told her of our having met Slade, and that he looked very ill. She said, ' Indeed! I believe he has felt the rector's death very acutely,' and changed the conversation. And now, Helen, my guess is, that Mary Aylmer is Slade's love, that he knows she loves another, and that he thinks that other is/.'

OLD St. Pancras Churchyard is one of the many places over which the advancing tide of London has remorselessly rolled, changing what was once a quiet secluded spot into one of the busiest thoroughfares of the great city. A network of railways above ground and below, and a monster hotel, now cover the place where once it lay. All lovers of romantic spots must ever grieve that advancing civilisation marches thus ruthlessly over so much haunted ground. Perhaps, however, the knowledge of what we have in this manner lost makes us all the more grateful for what is left. We can still, almost within hearing of the roar of London, meditate in the churchyard where Gray wrote his Elegy, and under the very ' yew tree's shade' where he may himself have sat; we may rest on the tomb in the churchyard at Harrow where Byron passed so many of his schoolboy hours; but the iron hand of progress has swept away for ever the willow that shaded the grave of Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin in old St. Pancras Churchyard, and effaced the spot where her gifted young daughter lay dreaming and reading in the long summer days, where she met the poet Shelley, and where ' unhesitatingly she placed her hand in his and linked her fortune with his own.' The daughter of an extraordinary father, and perhaps still more extraordinary mother, Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin was born in London on the 30th August 1797. Of her girlhood previous to her marriage there is not much to tell. Outwardly there was nothing to distinguish it from the ordinary life of girls in the middle class ; but from a little account she gives of herself in a preface to Frankenstein, and from touches here and there in her father's letters, we can gather that she was a dreamy, romantic girl, with an insatiable love of reading, which was rather repressed than encouraged. Her father, writing of her at the age of fifteen, says: ' Her desire of knowledge is great, and her perseverance in everything she undertakes almost invincible.' Her mother died at her birth. Her father, in spite of love for his first wife, as passionate as his calm nature was capable of, soon married again, and her step-mother was harsh and unNo. 43.—JULY 1878. j\n",

Finding that he required more money than he could make by liis writings to support a family establishment formed without making a previous provision for the support of it, her father became a bookseller. This family, for which he had to write hard and work hard, consisted of five children in all: Fanny, the daugliter of Mary Wollstonecraft before her marriage with Godwin, and Mary, the subject of the present memoir; two children by a previous marriage of the second Mrs. Godwin, Charles and Jane Clairmont; and William, the youngest, the only child of Godwin and his second wife. Jane Clairmont was indulged by her mother, while Fanny and Mary were checked and repressed. Mrs. Godwin's idea was, that ' each child should be educated to some definite duties, and with a view of filling some useful place in life.' But it was found that ' Jane Clairmont's mission was to have all the education and accomplishments which their slender means would admit of, while household drudgery was, from an early age, discovered to be the lifework of Mary and Fanny Godwin.' Her father seems to have deeply loved his children, and to have been much interested in their mental growth; but, like many other fathers, he had not, as he himself confesses, time to put his theories into practice with regard to his own family; so all the education Mary had till the time she left her father's house with Slielley was self-gained. ' That she was afterwards a worthy intellectual companion to Shelley is in no degree due to Mrs. Godwin, and little to her father's direct teaching.' Of herself she says:— ' It is not singular that, as the daughter of two persons of distinguished literary celebrity, I should very early in life have thought of writing. As a child I scribbled ; and my favourite pastime during the hours given me for recreation was to \" write stories.\" Still I had a dearer pleasure than this, which was the formation of castles in the air—the indulging in waking dreams. My dreams were at once more fantastic and agreeable than my writings ; they were all my own. I accoimted for them to nobody; they were my refuge when annoyed, my dearest pleasure when free. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near' (she is speaking of some time she spent in Scotland), ' that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered.' And SO her girlhood passed, spent chiefly in London, varied once by a long visit to Scotland when it was found that the growing girl required purer air than the house in Skinner Street could afford. She is described when about fifteen as being 'rather short, remarkably fair, and light-\n",

Mary was only fourteen when Shelley first became known to her father. The poet, like so many young men of the time, was attracted by the writings of Godwin, and regarded him as a very prophet of the great cause of truth and liberty, and the progress of humanity. Some letters passed between them, and in October 1812, She Uey and his wife visited the Godwins in London; but Mary was then looked upon as a child in her home, and Shelley seems to have taken no particular notice of her. They did not meet again until early in the summer of 1814. At this time Shelley was wretched. He had discovered that the dream of his youthful love was an illusion, that his wife was totally incapable of understanding or half appreciating him, and for long they had been living most unhappily together. The exaggerated and keen sensibility of his poetic nature made him feel every small trial with the greatest acuteness, and family troubles and vexations, which by ordinary men might have been forgotten, or thought lightly of, rubbed off in daily intercourse with the outside world, were brooded on till they became sorrows which it appeared to himself time could never heal. That a separation between him and his wife was impending when Shelley came to London is certain. That it did not take place sooner is deeply to be deplored; but it is at least some excuse for Mary Godwin that she was not the first cause of the breach between him and Harriet. Mary, too, was not happy. Her home, as we have shown, was ruled over by a step-mother, who, if not deliberately unkind, was at least totally unsympathetic; and when seen with a book in her hand, Mary was ' wont to hear from her that her proper sphere was the storeroom.' Some of us can perhaps recall such times in our own girlhood,—before the days of girls' colleges and local examinations,—when to be seen with a book was almost a crime, when we satisfied our love of reading and craving for knowledge anywhere out of sight, in some old lumber-room or underneath a favourite tree. There we dreamed and read, and read and dreamed, till fiction seemed more true than fact, and the poets and philosophers of our books were the only realities, and the people we lived among were shadows and dreams. Such a girl can we picture Mary Godwin to have been. No wonder that, when the poet of her dreams came to her in real life, she thought him almost divine.\n",

Shelley found in her sympathy and intellectual appreciation; to her he confided his griess, his hopes, his plans for the wellbeing of the human race: she listened, approved, advised. They were congenial spirits,—simpatica, as the Italians say, —and they had found each other. We can easily fancy that they met for a time without any feeling of wrong on either side, that they loved before they were aware of it. What opened their eyes we are not told ; but Godwin's suspicions which seem after a time to have been aroused, may have hastened the climax. On the 28th July 1814, within three months after they had met for this time, they left London together. That Mary Godwin's act was unpardonable from any point of view, is not to be denied ; still there are manifold excuses to be made for her. Through the teaching of her father, whom she deeply respected, and the writings of her mother, whose memory she reverenced, she had become familiarized with the idea that marriage was one of the institutions which a nobler era of mankind would sweep away, and in these ideas Shelley fully shared. Young and ardent minds do not readily distinguish between theory and practice, and it was not surprising if the visionary girl confounded opinions that were meant to take effect in a state of society altogether hypothetical, and actions done in society as at present constituted. When we consider her youth, her inexperience, her girlish trustfulness, her deep, passionate love for Shelley, his almost overpowering attractions, the fascination he exercised over all who knew him personally, and, above all, the atmosphere of tliought in which she had been brought up, we may, while fully. ' Owning lier weakness, Her evil behaviour,' without exceeding the limits of the ' charity which hopeth all things,' mingle a feeling of tender pity with our heartfelt condemnation of Mary Godwin's conduct. The events of the next few weeks were afterwards given to the world by Mrs. Shelley in the Six Weeks' Tour, published by her among Shelley's prose writings after his death. It is, however, as much her work as his, being passages from their joint diary, begun the night they left England together, and continued by one or other during all their married life.

Both Godwin and Shelley thought highly of the story, and it was reviewed and praised by Sir Walter Scott in Blackvjood's Magazine. On their return to England in September 1816, the poet and his wife again settled near the Thames, this time at Marlow in Buckinghamshire. Here their time was spent in works of active benevolence among the poor lace-workers of the neighbourhood, in the enjoyment of simple country pleasures, and in reading, which formed the chief delight of both. ' At home or travelling, before breakfast or waiting for the mid-day meal, by the side of a stream or on the ascent of a mountain, a book was never absent from the hands of one or other.' An event, which came as a shock to both of them, happened in November 1816; Harriet, Shelley's first wife, drowned herself in the Serpentine. A few weeks after, Shelley and Mary were married very quietly in London. Innocent as all Shelley's biographers assert he was of being the immediate cause of this rash act, he yet could by no means have felt guiltless, and the remorse he now endured affected his health and spirits. Another source of grief was added in the decision against him in Chancery, when, on account of his opinions, he was declared unfit to have the charge of his and Harriet's children. A fear alluded to in his Lines to William Shelley seems to have haunted him and Mary, that their boy might be taken from them like the others; so, for safety and change of scene, they determined to go abroad, and in March 1818 left England, to which She Uey was destined never to return. Four years of life in Italy followed,—a time which, when Mrs. Shelley looked back upon it in her sad widowhood, seemed to her full of golden days of 'pure and perfect delight' indeed. The nameless charm which Italy exercises over all poetical minds was fully felt by both the Shelleys. The dreamy Venice, like no other place in the world in the silence that pervades its ' watery streets;' Florence, the beautiful in nature and in art; the half-populated Pisa; the strange mixture of mediaeval civilisation with modern life, which lingers in all the towns of Italy; the intoxicating beauty of the environs of Naples, with its cloudless sky and waveless sea; Rome, the enchantress,'the capital of a vanished world,' with her streets, churches, pictures, fountains, and, above all, her ruins ' graced with an immaculate charm that\n",

      "298 ' Tlie Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine. Mary Shelley was only four-and-twenty years of age when the joy of her life was thus snatched away from her. It seemed to her truly a grief too terrible to bear. Her deep despondency, the utter abandonment of her misery, may be guessed from passages like the following in her private journal. The fragments of this diary read in some parts almost like a prose version of In Memoriam : '. . . I cannot grieve for you, beloved Shelley. I grieve for thy friends, for the world, for thy child, most for myself, enthroned in thy love, growing wiser and better beneath thy gentle influence, taught by you the highest philosophy — your pupil, friend, lover, wife, mother of your children. The glory of the dream is gone. I am a cloud from which the light of svmset has passed. Give me patience in the present struggle. Meum cordiuni cor. Good-night. ' \" I would give All that I am to be as thou now art; But I am chained to time and cannot thence depart.\"' Her boy alone was a source of interest and occupation to her; for him she lived henceforth, and for his sake, the year after Shelley's death, she left Italy, the land of her delights, and the land of her deep sorrows. So much was all belonging to Italy mixed up with tender memories of the past, that years after one word of the language was enough to bring tears to her eyes. The gloom of her native climate struck her on her return in painful contrast to the sunny skies she had left; it was to her as a type of the life she had to look forward to, compared to the sunny past that lay behind Shelley's grave. But she fought bravely with herself, and sought in literary pursuits an escape from her own brooding thoughts. At first she lived in London near her father, who was getting old, and who greatly enjoyed her society and that of his little grandson. Shelley's father made an attempt to obtain possession of the child; but, needless to say, his offers of money instead of her sole remaining treasure were indignantly refused. We must ever regret that through his tyrannical influence the world was deprived of a work which it still wants—a true story of Shelley's life. The one object of his widow, after the care of her boy, was to give to the world a life of her husband, and even before her return to England she began to collect materials and to prepare for it. But this cherished plan she was obliged to relinquish, on a threat from Sir Timothy Shelley that, if she persisted in it, all supplies would be withheld. Almost totally dependent on him as she was, she had no choice left. What that life would have been we shall never know. The work has been done, and may yet be done again and again, by others\n",

Debarred from the greater work she so desired, she did all that was possible, in editing his collected writings, with short biographical notes appended to the poems. Some of her remarks are touching and womanly in the extreme. For instance, she says she reprints the notes on Queen Mat, which she might with advantage have withheld, especially as Shelley himself thought they should not be republished, ' not because they are models of reasoning or lessons of truth, but hecause Shelley vjrote them.' In a few years, when her little son was old enough to go to school, she sent him to Harrow, and thither she removed, that she might be near him. In her retired life there, she devoted herself much to literature, and published several novels. These were— Valperga, in 1823; The Last Man, 1824; Perkin Warheek, 1830; Lodore, 1835; and Falkner, 19>Z'l. None of these are equal in merit to Frankenstein, although Tlie Last Man approaches it in style and in the horrible originality of the plot. The details of the story, the onward creeping approach of the plague that finally devastates the whole known world, till but one human being, the last of his race, is left to tell the tale, are worked out with a wildness of imagination and a horror that is truly appalling. Apart from the fact that' Mrs. Shelley wrote them,' there is nothing in any of her novels except Frankenstein to make them live. Her life, linked as it is with so many other great names, is much more interesting than her writings. Nevertheless, they have many merits. Although sentimental and melancholy, they are never morbid, but, on the contrary, pure and elevated in tone, and perfect in morality. She wrote besides two volumes of Ram Ues in Germany and Italy, many short articles in magazines and annuals. She contributed all the Spanish and Italian lives to the Cabinet Cyclopaedia except Tasso and Galileo, and much regretted that the former did not fall to her share. Contrary to what might have been expected from the daughter of William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft and the wife of Shelley, she never came forward either in her writings or otherwise as a holder of advanced views. Her opinions, conveyed in such remarks as the following, are singularly wise and calm: ' I believe we are sent here to\n",

In 1844 Sir Timothy Shelley died, and her son succeeded to the title. All restrictions as to the publishing of the long-delayed life of her husband were now removed, and she at once began again to think of accomplishing the object nearest her heart. But her task was never completed ; interruptions from sailing health prevented her, her energy gradually faded, and at last she died peacefully in London on the 21st February 1851, in the fifty-fourth year of her age. She lies beside her father and mother, both removed thither from St. Pancras, in the sunny churchyard of Bournemouth: ' Touch her not scornfully ; Think of her mournfully, Gently, and humanly ; Not of the stains of her— All that remains of her Now is pure womanly.' Such a life as Mary Shelley's, although not by any means the highest attainable, and darkened as it is by the shadow of her early sin, may yet serve as an example to many who have a clearer faith and a brighter hope than she ever had. ' To be something great and good was,' she says, ' the precept given me by my father; Shelley reiterated it,' and her sole endeavour was to act upon this maxim. The ' perfectibility' of the whole human race was the end, above all others, for which she and Shelley longed, and of which they loved to dream—the theme they were never weary of discussing. If slie failed either in attaining a very high standard for herself, or in materially raising those about her, it was not because she did not strive earnestly after all that she thought good and beautiful and true, but because all must fail' who count themselves so needful for success.' Her own words, almost the last in the published fragments of her diary, will serve to close this short memoir. If there is in them something that chi Us and disappoints us, it is because they are the words of one whose highest altar was raised to duty alone: ' The great work of life goes on. Death draws near. To be better after death tlian in life is one's hope and endeavour ; to be so through selfschooling.' F. G.\n",

DEAREST NELL,—I have another act of tragi-comedy going on here to tell you, and I am sure you are longing to know it. Truly the complication is strange. Yesterday I hired a horse and rode out to Burnham, for I thought I could do no less for old acquaintance' sake than call on Mary Aylmer. I asked for Mrs. Wimpole and was told she was in the garden ; so, giving my horse to the man, I set off to find her. Turning into a shrubbery walk which is the way to her favourite little flower garden, I saw two figures before me with their backs to me; they were no other than Mary Aylmer and Walter Benson, he talking earnestly with her hand in his, she looking up at him with a proud admiring glance. ' So this,' I said to myself, 'is poor Slade's rival! This is the husband \" with a little more of the devil in him\" whom she has chosen for herself! Pray Heaven there may not be a little too much of that ingredient!' I turned hastily away into another path, and seeing Mrs. Wimpole in the distance, made up to her. I could see by her walk and the cock of her bonnet that she was out of humour, and she gave me her left hand, as she always does in her grim moods. I ventured to allude to what I had seen. ' Yes,' she grunted, ' I suppose it's about all settled. A great fool she is, I think, not to take Slade. ... He kne AV her when she was with me two years ago, and has been devoted to her ever since; and for about as long, I believe, she has had a fancy for this scapegrace. He's seen a great deal of her lately in London, so that it has become serious. To tell the truth, when I asked her here, I thought Master Walter was not coming for several weeks, as I heard something about his going abroad, and I wanted to see if I could not give poor Slade one more chance. However, in the first five minutes' talk I had with her, I saw there was no hope of that, and then three days after this fellow turns up. Well, girls will settle their own affairs I I trust he will be steady and prove worthy of her; it is all his father can wish for him,—a sweet girl, money and\n",

Perhaps, if I was young again, I might do like Mary! Now, young people, let us go in to luncheon.' Up they came, looking very happy and confused, and we went in, Mrs. Wimpole and I keeping up a hot fire of talk and disputation to cover their blushes. When I came away, Walter followed me to the door, wrung my hand very hard, and said, ' Wish me joy, old fellow. I'm coming to see you very soon, and shall tell you all about it.' To-day I have been over to Sydwood to make my congratulations. The squire was running over with glee, charmed with his future daughter-in-law, and naturally much pleased with the other items, the ' money and prospects.' I hope these have not counted for too much with Walter himself, but one must not scan motives too narrowly. At all events, all the effect upon him has been good so far. Anrj. 28.—Walter came to see me to-day, and was in wild spirits. He was quite affectionate to me, and declared I should tie the knot. ' For you're the best fellow I know in the shape of a parson. I believe your religion's no humbug, and I used to think it was nothing but that in any of you. I shall have to be serious now, for Mary's very much that way inclined; but, hang it, it's very hard for a fellow like me to get into harness of that sort, after being in such a precious lot of scrapes as I've been in all my life, and not quite out of some of them yet perhaps.' He added the last words half to himself. I asked him what he meant, but he laughed it off, saying, ' Why, wouldn't many people say I've j ust run my head into the worst scrape of all ?' Finding him in excellent disposition for the purpose, I took the opportunity of giving him a good bit of my mind, both as to the past and future. I laid it on strongly and did not spare, and he took it all in very good part. He certainly is good-hearted and lovable, but I do not feel confidence in him. A little incident that occurred during this very visit rather troubles me. After he had sat about an hour and a half, I got up and said,' Now, Walter, if you won't go, I must leave you here, for I have got some parishioners to go and see.' ' Oh, hang it, let the parishioners take care of themselves for one day! It isn't often that you get a fellow like me to listen to your lecturing; I declare you're doing me good, and I shall be a much greater trii;mph to your skill than a dozen old women in the rheumatics.'

I told you she was coming to the neighbourhood. Two days after I was in the village, I overheard a woman say to her neighbour,' Ah, they'll make a fine couple,' and a moment after, turning a corner, came full upon the two. They seemed quite at their ease, and he was just asking her if she remembered something or other. It must be an old thing, settled before he came here; while I, poor fool, have been deluding myself and dreaming my best years away. I am afraid I hardly feel yet as a Christian should towards Eeynolds, for I have been told over and over again that he has given out that he did not intend to marry; he thought a clergyman should have as few worldly ties as possible, etc. Hypocrite! Mary has lately come of age, and into possession of her own fortune, which has probably altered his view! I cannot be mistaken, for under what other possible circumstances would she have been seen walking alone with him in the village ?

Things are not going well at the Bensons'. Mrs. Elvers and Jack came to me this morning in great trouble, to tell me it has transpired that Walter is still heavily in debt, and that he must have concealed much when a few months ago his father believed he had cleared him. It seems that a packet containing various letters, addressed to him at his chambers in London, was forwarded thence to Sydwood, and being unfortunately ill-directed, the squire opened it. Still fancying, in a sit of absence, that the letters were his own, he broke one of the seals, and the letter proved to be from a money-lender, referring to transactions on a lar2:e scale. The old man in a ra<;e went on to open the other letters, which also chiefly related to money matters, and proved that Walter had been trading not only on the chances of his father's death, but lately also on the prospect of his own marriage. Eeckless fellow ! I believe that through all he is attached to his father, and sincerely loves Mary ; but one false step has led him to another, till he has fairly gone down hill. He does not seem to have been so successful as he expected in silencing his creditors, for there were duns for a large amount among the letters, and the pressure put upon him with regard to the largest seemed to speak of some personal grudge. The old squire was still at his work when Walter came unsuspectingly into the library. I fancy the scene that followed was fearful, the old man's rage at having been deceived, being only paralleled by Walter's at having his letters broken into. I cannot guess what will happen next. I begged Mrs. Elvers to send for me on the instant if she thought I could be of the slightest use. Mary knew nothing about it when they came here. Sept. 4.—I had scarcely written so far on Saturday afternoon when Mrs. Elvers came back in the carriage and begged me to go with her to Burnham to help to break the news to Mary and her father, who came the night before.

'Well, we'll see,' said Mrs. Elvers; ' but she is so violent when she is roused, I hardly dare tell her!

Poor Mr. Aylraer met me heartily when I went in, and looked delighted to see me, but lie must soon have read in my face that something was wrong. I hardly know how I managed to get out the story. He looked very angry, and sat with his lips compressed, white and stony. Poor Mary was sent for, and between us we made her aware of the truth. She was fearfully cut up, but I think her pride came to her help, and would not let her betray all she felt. I think she would have borne anything for Walter, or any amount of poverty with him; but to feel that he has deceived her, and that perhaps after all his love has been mercenary—that must indeed have been bitter. There were none of the Bensons at church, yesterday. I went over again to-day to Burnham to see if I could be of any use. I had much talk with Mr. Aylmer, and even poor Mary seemed glad to speak to me. How fortunate it was that Mrs. Wimpole brought us together that day at Maldon Hill, so that she is able to look upon me as a friend, not merely as an acquaintance of long ago. I then went to Sydwood, and found all things in a terrible state of discomfort—the old squire angry and unreasonable, never leaving his own room but at meals, and then alternately storming and sulking; Walter bitter and defiant, never joining the family, and only just withheld, so far, by his • mother and sister, from rushing off to London, or Heaven knows where ; in which case it is but too probable he would never have been heard of again.

I went at once to his room, where I found him half dressed, wild and haggard, storming about and pulling everything out of the drawers, tearing up letters and muttering to himself. I had knocked, but he was making too much noise to hear me. He looked very angry when he saw me, and with a fierce oath ordered me out. By dint of being quiet and not caring for his violence, I came round him at last, and went down and told his mother to order his horse, for I was going to carry him off with me to Illingham. ' God reward you!' she exclaimed, and could say no more, and I came off with my captive. He is now installed in my spare room overhead, where he has been walking up and down, in creaking boots, for two hours, and has helped to give me a most desperate headache. I have been in to him once or twice, but he won't talk to me, and refused to come down to dinner. He has got papers and pens and ink lying about, and I think is trying to write to Mary.

It seems strange and unlike him to have gone off and left no trace, as he has done. Walter seems contented to be here, or rather does not talk of going, but he is in a miserable state of mind. His suspense until he knows his fate from Mary is terrible. I fear there is not a chance, but that she will give him up; and then — he is capable of anything! Good-bye. I must write a line to Beilby.

I am knocked up with a headache of two days, which makes my anxieties harder to bear. I had a note from Mrs. Elvers this morning, telling me that her father has heard from Mr. Aylmer, and (as was inevitable) that all connection between the two families must be at an end, and begging me to make this known to Walter. I went to his room and found him in one of his violent moods. A letter that he had sent to Mary yesterday had been returned to him unopened, in a cover directed by Mrs. Wimpole, with a few words to say that Mr. and Miss Aylmer had left when it arrived. She did not give their present address, and Walter is convinced that it is intended he is to be cast off unheard. He says he will not take his dismissal from any one but herself, and, cost what it will, he will find out where she is, write to her, and have her answer. ' If she gives me up, time enough then to think of the shortest exit out of this rotten old world,' he said with a gloomy laugh. I am glad of this delay, for I think every day gained in his present state of mind is a step towards saving him. He will be buoyed up by a grain of hope till he hears from her, and by tliat time perhaps calmer thoughts may have returned. I think better of him, too, now that I see the strength of his feeling. He is determined to leave my house and look out for a lodging at hand, saying he will no longer be a burden to me. I have opposed the plan to the utmost, for I would rather have him under my eye; and it will only be a greater burden to me to have the charge of him in another house ; but I can't manage him. I have visited four cholera patients to-day—three in Slade's parish, and one in my own. Most harrowing scenes; I cannot write of them.

My two women are at work all day long, preparing food and slops, etc., for the sick. I take them usually myself, as both Mary and Bell share greatly in the general panic. The work is a blessing to them, turning their thoughts; but I cannot force them to do more. Sometimes Walter comes with me and helps to carry my supplies; but he never will enter a house where a sufferer lies—not from physical, but from moral cowardice: his mind is not fitted to bear the spectacle. Mrs. Wimpole has sent me money and supplies of flannel, etc., to use as I think best.

To-day I met the doctor, and after we had exchanged counsels about the sick, he asked if I had heard what was all over the village about Margaret Scott. ' No, what ?' ' Why, sir, about her and Mr. Walter Benson. They say he was the person who flirted with her, or worse, and was the cause of all the trouble.' He went on to tell me that the knowing he was in the place had affected her dreadfully, and that she showed a horror of hearing his name; that she was, besides, very sensitive to all the misery around her; and that, in short, he feared for her mind.

This telescope was to be five years in bnilding. Only two years of that time have expired, but Mr. Grubb is making great efforts to have it completed by the month of August next, when the British Association will hold its meetings in Dublin. If not the largest, it is among the largest instruments of the kind ever constructed. The telescope will be 35 feet long, and is to have a magnifying power of 3000 diameters, which will bring the moon, as it were, within 80 miles of the earth. A sight of one of the lenses seemed to convey to an vinscientific observer, more than anything else, an idea of the enormous proportions of the instrument. It is a disc 28 inches in diameter, which measures 3 inches more than the telescope built five or six years ago by Mr. Cook of York. Mr. Grubb informed us that the man who prepared the glass for this lens had been two years at work before he got a piece perfect enough in quality for the purpose. The two lenses to be used in the telescope will cost £1200. The cost of the instrument as a whole will be £8000. We saw, also, the steel plates and framework for the revolving dome-shaped roof which is to cover the telescope when erected in its place at Vienna. Ten or twenty years ago Munich was the great emporium for telescopes, but Mr. Grubb told us that he has orders for instruments to be sent to several of the large cities in Germany, which shows that our country is now taking a foremost place in this high class of manufacture. floticf S ta Corrrspontirnts, etc. LADIES are invited to contribute to this magazine.

' You daren't, Walter,' said I, and his hand dropped. Half by persuasion, half by force,. I got it from him, drew the charge, and pocketed it.

At Morwick, where I left the railway, Mrs. Wimpole met me. I saw in her face, white and reproachful, that all was as bad as had reached me.

IT has often struck us, during the present series, while considering the lives and commenting upon the works of female writers of our fictitious literature, how invariably the interest and romance of the career and of the books seem to increase or diminish in an exact ratio of inverse proportion the one to the other. This may seem a fanciful, nay, a paradoxical idea; but M-e could adduce many instances, and, the principle once conceded, illustrations of the fact and solutions of the problem will readily occur to most of us. A problem we call it advisedly, for at first sight one might be tempted to think that, in order to tell a striking story, and to tell it well, the narrator must have passed through striking scenes, must have ' lived' incidents, and been, moreover, gifted with the power of looking through outward events to the hidden springs of human pride and passion which lie deep beneath. In short, it might seem that to sit quietly at home, surrounded by the petty cares, duties, and pleasures of ordinary home life, with little or no power of varying the scene, though it might afford facilities for writing books whose value depended upon calm and sober judgment and critical accuracy, could never give fair play to the exercise of a novelist's peculiar powers. Often, in our list of authoresses, we have dwelt upon lives of women interesting and charming in their day, associates of the leading wits and great men of the period, with their own histories full of stir and romance, e.g. Sydney Owenson and Mary Shelley. But when we turn to their books, these are mere names, or at best literary curiosities of bygone date, to be looked at with interest much like that with which we survey our grandmother's court dress or Sunday bonnet. Others in our list have, from the extreme monotony of their lives, coupled with the reticence that long shrouded our English authoresses from public notice, completely succeeded in baffling the efforts of biographers, for the simple reason that there was nothing to say about their lives and homes that would interest readers who yet hailed with delight each succeeding No. 45.—SEPTEMBER 1878. 9 „\n",

We must confess to having, in general, small power of sympathy with the ' oppressed governess' of fiction ; in fact, we generally find ourselves in the case of pitying the employers rather than the employed. Angela is a complete exception to this rule, a charming compound of sweetness and energy. There is not a line of morbid sentiment in the book, and her trials in schoolroom and drawing-room are true to the life of forty years ago, though we think that such treatment as Mrs. Usherwood's would hardly be attempted in the present generation. Augusta Darby is a clever contrast to Angela, with her spendthrift father and home where all elegance and comfort are sacrificed to the racing stables, with the deteriorating effects on the girl's own fine character. We pass lightly over The, Previsio Tis of Lady Evelyn, a pretty but slighter work, to her next group, published about 1850. Mordaimt Hall is a story prolonged over three generations, giving first a sad exemplification of the baneful effects of that school of thought to which our attention has been ably directed by the biographer of Mary Shelley.^ A beautiful girl is brought up in a wild romantic home by a father whom she reveres, and who is amiable and worthy iu all respects save one, that he has no religious principle on which to rest all other teaching. The gradual moulding of Miriam's mind under this fatal system is touchingly well described, the father, wrapt in abstruse studies, sailing to perceive that what was theory to him was reduced to practice by the untaught motherless child insensibly passing into womanhood before his eyes. ' Not even her father had the slightest idea of the true state of her mind, of the extent to which in the simplicity of her heart she carried out, or the perfect sincerity with which she adhered to, the opinions she had adopted. Men are often astonished when they see women, in the generous honesty of their nature, prepared to act upon and to carry to their extreraest consequences the notions and theories they have themselves too carelessly suffered them to imbibe ' {Mordaunt Hall, vol. i.). In such a state of matters the catastrophe astonishes no one ; but not the less natural or well depicted is the unhappy father's despair on learning the practical development of his own views in poor Miriam's case, and his horror at his own failure to make her understand the terrible position in which betrayal and desertion have left her..

I believe he is over the crisis of his malady, and the mental storm is calmer too. Instead of the violence of the preceding days, he had the look of one conscience-stricken and ashamed. I gave him all Eeynolds' messages word for word. ' Does he say all that ?' said he; ' then, perhaps, there is hope for me yet! But how is he ? is he dying V 'I think he is better,' said I. ' Thank Heaven for that!' returned he; 'if he had died, I killed him. I have killed my father; my mother and poor Jack are watching him die. My poor Emily here is wearying herself out with me. I have ruined them all! What should any one want to keep such a God-forsaken wretch as me in the world for ?' (He raised himself up in the bed, and grew very much excited.) ' I tell you, Slade, it is no use preaching to me. I have done nothing but mischief all my days. There's a poor girl here whose life I have cursed; and a poor honest fellow, they tell me, came to his end somehow through my folly! . . . Then I have blighted HER life too. She hates me now, and I deserve it!' ... He meant Mary, I knew. (Heaven forgive me ! I believe if he had thought she loved him still, I must have left him in his misery !) Mrs. Rivers and I drew hini gently down in the bed again, and she soothed him with caresses. I said, ' What message am I to carry back to Eeynolds, then? Am I to tell him that all his labour has been in vain, and that, though by God's mercy just rescued from death, you are still raving, thankless and despairing ?' This was the right chord. ' No, no,' said Walter, calming down in a moment; ' tell him I will live, if it please God. I will try to bear my life ... I will try to be a better fellow; though how it is to be done, or what is to become of me. Heaven knovv's !' I added a few words of comfort on my own part, and left. On coming back to Eeynolds' room, I found him either asleep or in the old stupor, and poor Jack Benson sitting bolt upright in the chair opposite to him, and crying with all his might. How this young man has won his way into all their hearts, and what good he has wrought in this short time, while I, in my pride and self-sufficiency, have been despising him and thwarting him at every turn!

Well, I was right in my conjecture, and poor Slade went and fretted over his disappointment, and hated me more and more for three whole weeks by himself in A Vales, and then came back to find himself all wrong, and me in what case you know; since which time he's changed utterly. He doesn't even talk in big words now. Tiiere isn't a tenderer-hearted fellow in the world; and he's such a nurse ! He nursed old j\\Ir. Miller for years.

We got through the night pretty well, and this morning came Mrs. Wimpole, and Mrs. Elvers, and the young gentleman who always figured in Frederick's letters as Jack. Then came the doctor and cheered us up as I told you, and then I went up to sit with Fred. Presently I was startled by a wonderful apparition. The door opened and tliere came stealthily in a figure as thin and gaunt as our dear Fred himself, with clothes hanging loose upon him, and long black locks falling shaggy over a pale unshaven face. His expression was most rueful; but you will understand it all (for you are well up in the history, I know) when I tell you it was Walter Benson. It seems he could endure no longer without seeing Eeynolds for himself; so he took the opportunity of being for a minute alone, and without leave of doctor or nurse, gathered himself up and presented himself in the guise I have described. ' Yoto here, Walter!' exclaimed Fred. 'Why, how dare you do such a thing ? Go back to bed; you'll get a chill and kill yourself!'

England was nevermore loyal than when James the Second's cause triumphed at Sedgemoor ; but the terror inspired by the ' Bloody Assize' grew to open discontent when James suddenly raised his army to 20,000 men, and filled it with Catholic officers. In vain Parliament j^rotested at this violation of the Test Act; James, finding it refractory, prolonged and finally dissolved it, supplying his treasury by a secret subsidy from France. Armed with an illegal decision, extorted from the judges, in favour of Sir Edward Hales, a Catholic, James next admitted Catholics to all civil and military offices, and sanctioned the public exercise of Catholic worship. He revived the High Court of Commission, abolished by two Acts of Parliament, and began a series of attacks upon the Church. Especial indignation was excited by the ejection <jf the Fellows of Magdalen College, Oxford, for maintaining a President legally elected by themselves instead of two unqualified candidates recommended by the king. To win the Nonconformists, James published (1G87) a Declaration of Indulgence, dispensing with all religious tests. Whether the statutes thus annulled were good or bad, James in this acted unconstitutionally. A second Declaration (April 1C88) was ordered to be rend in the churches, and a petition against it, presented by Archbishop Sancroft and six of his suffragans, was received by James with great anger. 'The Seven Bishops' were imprisoned and tried, but acquitted, to the delight of the nation. The birth of an heir to the throne (June 1C88) precipitated the crisis by destroying the hopes of the succession of James's Protestant daughter Mary. An invitation to England, signed by seven leading English noblemen, was sent to William of Orange, who landed with 13,000 men at Torbay, November 1G88. HEATHER. II.

A little way back from the houses stands the church ; behind this, again, the parsonage, ugly and uninteresting, with an unbounded view to the back over moorlands of the wildest description, which reach to the churchyard and parsonage garden Myalls. The churchyard is crowded full of monuments and old stones, all in greatest confusion. The whole place and country are bleak and weird, and at the time of which we write—our heroines' early years—there can have been no communication with the outer world for many months in the year. The childhood of these talented women—too early left motherless—was passed under the care of their father, the eccentric incumbent of Haworth, and an invalid aunt who could do but little for their welfare. Like Topsy, the six children simply 'growed,' finding amusements, interests, and education for themselves. The two eldest,Maria and Elizabeth, died young, and in 1825 Charlotte at ten years old was the eldest of four little things—herself, Branwell, Emily, and Anne. Her first life experience was sad ; at Cowan Bridge, the school made famous by her indignant pen, as Lowood in Jane Eyre, she saw her elder sisters sink under the hardships endured there. After their death, Charlotte and Emily were removed, and spent their next years at home with their one brother, Patrick Branwell, and youngest sister Anne. Many a curious story is told of their childish precocity and passionate love of books and newspapers. Their aunt taught the little girls sewing and a few household duties ; and thus time passed, till at fifteen Charlotte went again to school at Eoe Head, not twenty miles from home. Here she had a happier school life than before, finding in Miss Wooler not only an excellent schoolmistress, but a lifelong friend. Shy, reserved, and physically delicate, Charlotte shrank from the usual type of boisterous school-girl; she made, therefore, but two friends at Eoe Head, both known to us through Mrs. Gaskell's Life—the one as the ' E.,' the other as the ' Mary,' to whom the interesting letters given in that volume are mostly addressed. Two years later, and we have in a lately published Monograph ^ the following vivid description of the young Brontes on their way to join a picnic party at Bolton Abbey : 'Their conveyance is no handsome carriage, but a rickety dogcart, unmistakably betraying its neighbourship to the carts and ploughs of some rural farm-yard.

Jean's old mother does not think so, however, as she stands tliere at the corner of the street murnmring in her musical patois (an odd mixture of French, Spanish, and Arabic, very like the romance of the troubadours) a prayer which runs somewhat thus: ' O Sknti Mario, Que policies en flour Chanja nbsti plour, Clinos len I'aurito, Devers ma doiilour.' 'O Holy Maries, Who to flowers Can change our tears, Incline soon the ear Unto my grief.' The Holy Llaries are the patronesses of Provence. Tradition says that, after our Lord's death, some of His most fervent disciples, amongst whom were Lazarus, Martha, Mary Magdalene, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and the ' other Mary,' were placed by tlie Jews in a boat without sail or oar or rudder, and were abandoned to the waves that bore them safely to the little island of Camargue, near Marseilles. Mary Magdalene retired to the desert of Sainte Baume, where she wept till her tears formed the little river of the Huveaune; her companions preached in the various cities of Provence, and converted those countries to Christianity. In death they were all again united in the island of Camargue. In 1448 they revealed the presence of their bones to good King Eene, who built a magnificent church on the island, which has since been the scene of many pilgrimages. Such is the legend, believed by the simple Proven^aux. The nights at Cannes are even more lovely than the days, and after the chill of the sunset hour is past it is no longer dangerous to go out.

      "Our Female Novelists. 485 years old, was one of those sorrows which leaves its mark upon a life. To outward appearance all may be as before ; but the iron has entered into the soul, ' and the heart will never cease to vibrate.' In the year 1836 matters came to a climax, and Mr. Norton brought an action for divorce against his wife, coupling with her name that of Lord Melbourne.' There does not seem to have been the smallest ground for this step; indeed, it is more than hinted that Mr. Norton allowed himself to be made the tool of some of Lord Melbourne's political opponents. That statesman, then a man of fifty-seven, whose grown-up daughter. Lady Mary Fox, was warmly attached to Mrs. Norton, had been a true and wise friend to the latter. No doubt the post of confidential adviser to a young and beautiful woman on bad terms with her husband is a dangerous one, and so Lord Melbourne found it to his cost. But there never was a doubt of the result; the jury pronounced an acquittal without ever leaving their box; and next day the King publicly congratulated Lord Melbourne on having thus baffled the malice of his enemies. But in all such cases, the heaviest penalty is borne by the woman. The wife could not forget the insult, the cruel wound dealt her by him who should have been the first to shield her, and a separation was shortly afterwards arranged. Lord Melbourne had written in one of his earlier letters : ' I have always told you that a woman should never part from her husband whilst she can remain with him. If this is generally the case, it is particularly so in such a case as yours; that is, in the case of a young, handsome woman, of lively imagination, fond of company and conversation, and whose celebrity and superiority have necessarily created many enemies.' The event showed how true were his words. Feeling herself deeply injured, and naturally looking for sympathy under the unmerited troubles which had befallen her, she found herself, on the contrary, a mark for envy and ill-will. The shafts of petty malice struck deep and rankled ; with her proud, emotional nature, the injustice and harsh judgment she met with, stung her to the quick; she resented her wrongs keenly, and ' gave back scorn for scorn.' But years passed: ' Time and fair life bore down ill report.'

On the death of Queen Elizabeth, James VI. of Scotland claimed the throne of England in right fif his groat-grandmother, Margaret Tudor, eldest daughter of King Henry VII. From this princess he was descended in two lines, by his mother in the tirst place, and also by his father. From his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, he derived his undoubted right, and from his father, Henry Lord Darnley, he inherited what might have been a rival pretension to the vacant tlirone, as they were descended respectively from the first and second marriages of Margaret Tudor. By lier first marriage, to James IV., she left a son, James V., who was the father of Mary Queen of Scots. By her second marriage, to Archibald Douglas Earl of Angus, she left one daughter. Lady Margaret Douglas, who married Matthew Stuart Earl of Lennox, and became the mother of Henry Lord Darnley. The marriage of Queen Mary and Darnley and the birth of James VI. thus united in one person the two strongest claims to the throne of the Tudor kings. B.\n",

To show the manner of her juvenile epistles, we quote the following, which, it strikes us, might be suitable for translation into Latin at a University examination: * If we delight in umbrageous vales, verdant fields, and crystal ■ waters, we feel the delight arise with treble poignance when we find them at the foot of rugged rocks, and encircled by barren mountains.' This is quite Shaksperian; it reminds us of the stanzas spoken by Pyramus in the Midsummer Night's Dream. Miss Seward was herself a severe critic of literary style. That of Addison, generally thought faultless, she accuses both of inelegance and redundancy, and prophesies that Johnson's style will, in the future, invariably have the preference over Addison's. Had Miss Seward applied the prophetic lens to the future of her own works, what would have been the result ? Her expectations in this respect were probably as stilted as her own compositions. And in one respect her works occupy a very elevated position with regard to others,—viz., they generally adorn the highest shelves in the library. But that which intrinsic merit can only partially attain, is often secured by the aid of external circumstances; and as long as Johnson, Darwin, Garrick, and Scott are remembered, the name of Anna Seward will Temain as a link in the chain of literary friendships by which these choice spirits were bound together. One of the members of this circle at Lichfield was a Mr. George Butt. He was a descendant of the ancient family of Butt or de Butt, who had come in witli the Conqueror. He was the father of an authoress of a very different stamp from Miss Seward, namely Mrs. Sherwood. In the autobiography of the latter distinguished lady, we find Miss Seward described as one of the queens of society in Lichfield, a woman such as we read of in romances, a very Circe, who, though to all appearance possessed of no magic spell, yet bore away the palm of admiration from the young and beautiful. Mrs. Sherwood adds that she fascinated even those who condemned her conduct. We may well imagine how even the smallest semblance of coquetry would appear unpardonable to such a woman as the authoress of the Faircliild Family. Mary Martha Butt was born in 1775, at the rectory of Stanford in Worcestershire.

Mr. Butt, suspecting that both Mary and Marten were going to be geniuses, shut them up one morning in his study, with the command that each of them should write a story. The children were never informed which of the stories was pronounced to be the best. When about fifteen years old, she was sent to the Abbey School at Beading, kept by two French ladies. Her answer to the French master, when he inquired after her attainments, is amusing: ' \"Eh lien! Mademoiselle,\" ho said, \"have you any knowledge of French? \" \"No, sir,\" I answered. \" Are you much acquainted with history ? \" And he went on from one thing to another, asking me questions and always receiving a negative. At length, smiling, he said, \"Tell me. Mademoiselle, then, what you do know.\" I stammered, \"Latin—Virgil,\" and finished off with a regular flood of tears. At this he laughed outright, and immediately set me down in his class, and gave me lessons for every day.' Her earliest work, the Traditions, was written in 1794, while on a visit with her father to Lord Valentia. It was her habit to write in her own room, and then put up the manuscript in one of the cases of the dressing-table. But one day her father, coming into the room and finding the manuscript, was so much delighted with it that he took it and showed it to others. These friends specially admired the ingenious outline of the story, in spite of the slight blunder made in allowing the hero to have two wives existing at the same time. Putting this aside, however, the story is remarkable as the work of a girl of seventeen. So enchanted was her father with it, that, in spite of persuasion to the contrary, he had it published by subscription for the benefit of a friend in distress ; and so Miss Butt stood before the public as an authoress before she had completed her nineteenth year. In the autumn of the same year she began her second book, Margarita. While this was in progress, Mrs. Eadclift'e's Mysteries of Udolpho was being read aloud by way of insx^iration. The character of Canon Bernardo in Margarita was universally recognised to be drawn from her father. He died, however, before the book was completed, and at first she had not the heart to go on with it. The first thing she wrote on resuming her story, was the death of Canon Bernardo. During the following summer, her brother came to spend the long vacation at home; he taught her botany and Greek, the latter of which she continued to study until she had read the first six books of Homer. she now led an ideal life of seclusion from the world, of whicli she still remained comparatively ignorant.

In 1417, Henry being in Normandy, we find Oldcastle conspiring with the Scotch who were invading England ; but his plans were frustrated by their sudden retreat. He was taken, and condemned by Parliament to die as a heretic and traitor. Many other less noted victims suffered, but Lo Uardism lived on, preparing the way for the Reformation. HEATHER. II. Sir John Mandeville the traveller, called the father of English prose. He was bom early in the 14th century, and after travelling for thirty years, and penetrating to India and even China, he returned to England about 1350; and his book, previously written in Latin and in French, appeared in English in 1356. He meant it to be useful as an itinerary to Jerusalem. It ia very readable to this day, and fairly reliable as far as his own travels are concerned, though these are mixed up with astounding fables collected from former writers and from hearsay. Sir Thomas Malory, knight, author of the prose epic called the Morte Arthur, printed in 1485 by Caxton, who suggested the idea of the work carried out by Malory. He has compiled a history of Arthur, in which the materials drawn, some from Cymric, some from Teutonic sources, and very unlike in spirit as well as matter, are welded together in a harmonious connected story, written in beautiful English, and giving us an embodiment of the chivalric ideal of the Middle Ages. Sir Thomas More, born 1478, died 1535. He wrote some histories and controversial works, but his Utopia, which has given an adjective to our language, is his chief book. It is the description of a fancied island, with an ideal government, discovered by a companion of Amerigo Vespucci's. Many of our modern improvements in laws and manners are suggested by Utopia, a book of true genius, and from a social and political point of view greatly in advance of its age. CLAKIBEL.

In the neighbourhood of her early liome there are many old Halls and Manors, where, in spite of the vicinity of democratic Manchester and other manufacturing towns, such unadulterated Toryism lingered as she has described with such a kindly pen in the characters of Squire Hatnley and my Lady Ludlow. Quiet, uneventful wedded life succeeded these years of insensible education and formation of opinions. About the year 1832 she became the wife of the Eev. William Gaskell, minister of a Unitarian chapel in Cross Street, Manchester, and there she was brought into immediate and personal contact with the restless, intelligent population of that centre of the manufacturing districts, at a time of great political agitation and of grinding public distress. Her position as a minister's wife no doubt gave her many opportunities of becoming intimately acquainted with the middle and artisan class, of which she writes so well; and in Manchester she made one honoured friend, Avhose life-work and experiences may perhaps have given that tinge of sadness which so largely pervades all her books. In Mary Barton she writes thus :— ' \" Sick, and in prison, and ye visited me.\" Shall yon or I receive such blessing. I know one who will. An overseer of a foundry, an aged man with hoary hair, has spent his Sabbaths for many years in visiting the prisoners and the afflicted in Manchester New Bailey ; not merely advising and comforting, but putting means into their power of regaining the virtue and peace they had lost ; becoming himself tlieir guarantee in obtaining employment, and never deserting those who have once asked help from him.' These words can refer to no other than Thomas Wright, the' Manchester Prison Philanthropist,'who, following in the steps of the reformer Howard, gave himself during the greater part of his hard-working life to the Christ-like work of seeking and saving the lost. Until the year 1852 he earned his bread in the sweat of his brow, spending his scanty leisure and more than a third of his weekly wages in the w^ork of mercy he had chosen. At the age of sixty-three a public subscription was set on foot, to provide him with an income sufficient to release him from the necessity of daily toil. Upwards of £3000 was raised, and Thomas Wright was thus enabled to devote his declining years entirely to the work he loved so well, in which, we believe, his labours had been blessed with a large amount of success.

Gaskell's marvellous fertility iu tale-writing, as well as the picturesqueness and tragic cast of most of her stories, may owe something to her friendship with this ' Son of Consolation,' and embody many an ' ower true tale.' She has herself described the personal experience which, year after year, wrought in upon her soul that deep impression to which we owe her first and most powerful novel. ' For three years past trade had been getting worse and worse, and the price of provisions higher and higher. This disparity between the amount of the earnings of the working classes and the price of their food, occasioned in more cases than could well be imagined disease and death. Whole families went through a gradual starvation. They only wanted a Dante to record their sufferings, and yet even his words would fall short of the awful truth : they could only present an outline of the tremendous facts of the destitution that surrounded thousands upon thousands in tlie terrible years 1839, 1840, and 1841. It need excite no surprise, then, to learn that a bad feeling between working men and the upper classes became very strong in this season of privation. The most deplorable and enduring evil that arose out of the period of commercial depression to which I refer, was this feeling of alienation between the diflerent classes of society. It is so impossible to describe, or even faintly to picture, the state of distress which prevailed in the town at that time, that I will not attempt it, and yet I think again, that surely in a Christian land it was not known even so feebly as words could tell it, or the more happy and fortunate would have thronged with their sympathy and aid. In many instances the sufferers wept first and then they cursed.' Mrs. Gaskell lived to see Lancashire pass through such another season of widespread distress, when, through the total failure of the cotton supply during the American war, mill after mill stood closed and silent, and ' the famine was sore in the land;' but with what noble patience and manly reasonableness was the suffering borne, and with what sympathy and thoughtful tenderness did all classes combine, from the Sovereign and the peer to the meanest peasant, to alleviate, as much as might be, the pressure of the calamity ! Mrs. Gaskell was one of the foremost in counsel and in action for relief, and must surely have felt that among the influences which had created a kindlier feeling between gentle and simple her pen had done some service. Mary Barton and North and South had not been written in vain. It would be interesting to know—but we are unable to satisfy our own or our readers' curiosity on this point— whether Mrs. Gaskell had early been in the habit of composition, or had for any time cherished the ambition of becoming an author.

There are many passages in her books where she seems to hold back the full meed of censure, as if restrained by the feeling which has been thus beautifully expressed:— ' Yet teach me, God, a milder thought, Lest I, of all Thy blood liatli bought, Least honourable be ; And that which moves me to condemn. Be rather want of love for them Than jealousy for Thee.' It is, however, 'certain that the Lancashire magnates of that day were by no means flattered by the picture she drew of them, and denounced Mary Barton as a mischievous book, calculated to inflame ignorant and excitable minds. Yet it made her same, and from that time forward, even before her name became generally known,' a new novel by the author of Mary Barton' was an intellectual pleasure eagerly anticipated at brief intervals by a large circle of readers, while its repeated issue in numerous editions testifies to its undying popularity. It can hardly be necessary here to recall the outlines of any of these charming books, which, happily for the increase of goodness, of instruction, and delight, are entering on a new lease of life in Messrs. Smith & Elder's attractive series of green volumes. Having once broken silence, she continued to publish at such brief intervals as to suggest the idea that authorship mi;st have long been an intention in her mind, and that she had ample stores of material laid by for future use. She certainly had the gift of telling a story in a high degree, and it is only since her death, and from the collections which have been made of her minor tales, that we have really any idea of the astonishing activity of her pen. In 1850 she published, still anonymously, the exquisite little tale of T Jie Moorland Cottage. It is scarcely so well known as others of her minor tales, and until its reproduction in later collections of these, it was not very generally connected with her name. This seems strange, as it is quite on a level with others, such as Cousin Pliyllis, which obtained much favour among her admirers, the reason being, probably, that it came out before she had secured the vantage ground of a popular writer.

Yet her story of the strange, sad life of Charlotte Brontii is full of power and beauty, and it certainly achieved her object—the correction of the world's harsh but not unnatural judgment of her friend. To return to her novels. Butli appeared in 1853, and was almost as hotly discussed as Mary Barton had been. By some it was pronounced a most improper book, faulty as to its moral, and incorrect as a piece of art. To others it seemed ' admirable as to the temper of the tale,' ' marked throughout by perfect simplicity and truthfulness,' ' a good, righteous, and true book.' There must have been, we imagine, some strong reason why Mrs. Gaskell's thoughts dwelt so persistently on the perplexing question round which she has woven this very touching, and in many respects beautiful story—a question which reappears, too, in several of her lesser tales. Perhaps the experiences of her good old Manchester friend had interested her deeply in more than one shipwrecked life, which might have been saved from utter despair if some timely hand had been held out—if the lost one had met with some heart capable of that patience of Divine pity which ' doth devise means that His banished be not expelled from Him.' But though the story is full of lessons of Christian charity, and though the deepening and purification of Euth's character is beautifully worked out, we agree with the critics who find fault from an artistic point of view; and we cannot but feel that the main question of the book is not divested of one of the difficulties which surround it. We do not think, as some do, that Mr. Benson's conduct is unnatural in one so sincerely religious. Short-sighted mortals, however good they may be, are too apt, under strong pressure in order ' to do a great right,' to ' do a little wrong.' But we think that one so personally holy would hardly have carried the deception to the length he did (in the matter of Mr. Bradshaw's situation), and would have been more chastised by conscience after the painful discovery. In spite of the general tone of sadness which pervades it, this novel contains some of Mrs. Gaskell's choicest bits of humour. Miss Faith is a delightful contrast to her gentle brotlier; and their old servant Sally, with her fidelity, shrewd common sense, and crabbed tongue, is one of our author's best creations. We must give ourselves the pleasure of quoting her lecture to the heavy-hearted Euth on doing service with good-will. ' There's a right and a wrong -nay of setting about everything. . . .\n",

      "10 The Ladies' Edinburgh Magazine. Making a bed may be done after a Christian fashion I take it, else what's to come of such as me in heaven, who've had little enough time on earth for clapping ourselves down on our knees for set prayers. When I was a girl ... I took to praying and sighing and giving up the world ; and I thought it were wicked to care for the flesh, so I made heavy puddings, and was careless about dinner and the rooms, and thought I was doing my duty though I did call myself a miserable sinner. But one night the old missus (Master Thurstan's mother) came in and sat down by me, . . . and says she, \"Sally, what are you blaming yourself about and groaning over? We hear you in the parlour every night, and it makes my heart ache.\" \"Oh, ma'am,\" says I, \"I'm a miserable sinner, and I'm travailing in the new birth.\" \" Was that the reason,\" says she, \" why the pudding was so heavy to-day ? \" \" Oh, ma'am, ma'am,\" says I, \" if you would not think of the things of the flesh, but trouble yourself about your immortal soul.\" And I sat a-shaking my head to think about her soul. \"But,\" says she, in her sweet-dropping voice, \"I do try to think of my soul every hour of the day, if by that you mean trying to do the will of God ; but we'll talk now about the pudding. . . . Did it answer God's purpose and serve Him, when the food was unfit for a child to eat, and unwholesome for any one ?\" Well, I would not give it up, I was so pig-headed about my soul; so says I, \" I wish folks would be content with locusts and wild honey, and leave other folks in peace to work out their salvation ;\" and I groaned out pretty lovid to think of missus' soul. I often think since she smiled a bit at me, but she said, \" Well, Sally, to-morrow yon shall have time to work out yonr salvation ; but as we have no locusts in England, and I don't think they'd agree with Master Thurstan if we had, I will come and make the pudding, but I shall try and do it well, not only for him to like it, but because everything may be done in a right way or a wrong ; the right way is to do it as well as we can, as in God's sight; the wrong is to do it in a self-seeking spirit, which either leads us to neglect it to follow out some device of our own ends, or to give up too much time and thought to it, both before and after the doing.\" ' It is curious to find how Mrs. Gaskell has clung to favourite little touches, or has reproduced in her more important works ideas which first budded in some of her smaller tales. In My Lady Ludlow we find another Sally, who takes a sit of negligence under the guise of devout anxiety, ' talking about the state of her soul and that sort of thing. But when I found the meat all roasted to a cinder, I said, \" Come, Sally, let's have no more praying when beef is down at the fire. Pray at six o'clock in the morning and nine at night, and I won't hinder you.\" So she sauced me and said something about Martha and Mary, implying that because she had let the beef get so overdone . . . she had chosen the better part. ... So when tea-time comes, there enters my maid with her hump on her back, and her soul to be saved. \" Please, ma'am, did you order the pound of butter ? \" \" No, Sally,\" I said, shaking my head, \" this morning I did not go round by Hale's farm, and this afternoon I have been employed in spiritual things.\" . . .

' For that matter, we're all o' us fond o' turning the best breadth o' the gown to the front. I remember, speaking o' breadths, how I've undone my skirts many a time and oft, to put a stain or a greasespot next to poor Mr. Goodenough. He'd a soft kind of heart when first we was married, and he said, says he, \"Patty, link thy right arm into my left one, and then thou'lt be nearer to my heart.\" So I always put my damaged breadths on the right hand, and when we walked arm in arm, as we always did, no one was never the wiser.' North and South, which succeeded Butli in 1855, was evidently intended to put forward the manufacturers' view of the antagonism between labour and capital. It has all the charms of Mrs. Gaskell's writing in the liveliness of the dialogue, the spirit and interest of the scenes, and in the excellent portraiture of character. But it is by no means as strong and successful a plea as was its predecessor, Mary Barton, on the opposite side, and the story is, in many respects, an ill constructed one. In spite of her being retained in the cause of the manufacturer, she is obliged to ruin her hero before she can overcome the aversion between North and South, and unite him to his scornful lady-love. Mr. Hale's religious scruples, too, are but a clumsy expedient for transplanting him and his family to Milton. Mrs. Gaskell here writes under some constraint, or else enters upon subjects she does not sufficiently understand, both here and in those parts of the story which concern the exiled son. A longer gap than usual (during which the Life of Charlotte Bronte came out) intervened before the publication of the next novel, which, with two other tales of exceeding merit, form a group in what we may call Mrs. Gaskell's later style. In Sylvias Lovers, Cousin Bhillis, and Wives and Daughters, we find all her earlier excellences enhanced by the development of her maturer powers. Praise and popularity do not always stimulate authors to such improvement as distinguishes the three last works of this gifted writer. As a wellconstructed dramatic story, the first-named is superior, we think, to any of its predecessors, not excepting Mary Barton, though perhaps it possesses less of the charm of delicate humour than some of the others.

Yet there is something very fascinating about it in spite of these drawbacks. For one thin\", it is almost as amusing to watch as to play, and a game is over so quickly that the interest never flags. Ladies find it a great saving in mental wear and tear, not to mention money; for they have not to consider what to put on, and I do not think even the most extravagant of girls indulges in half-a-dozen tennis dresses. The dress itself requires to be short, and looks best in inexpensive materials; flowing silks and velvets only entail on their wearer perpetual annoyance. The beautifully embroidered aprons now worn are a legitimate field for the display of feminine taste and industry. Some of them are quite artistic with their groups of real-looking flowers or autumn leaves wreathed round. I am afraid if any of my readers expected a learned dissertation on the rules and aim of the game, with a short account of its origin, and hoped to have all the knotty points gone thoroughly into, the reasons for and against put in order, and finally the law laid down incontrovertibly, they will be disappointed. A recapitulation of the rules to those who know tennis well would be simply a bore, and to those who know it not at all would be unintelligible; besides, there have been so many new rules added lately, that there is now almost as great a diversity of opinion on what the rules are, as there used to be in croquet, with the same result that each ground holds its own. Consequently every rule I laid down as absolute, invariable and unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, would provoke a discussion or a denial from some quarter or another, so for my own sake I refrain. To those who really desire information on the subject irrespective of a wish to argue, I refer to The Lavjs of Lawn Tennis as adopted hi/ the Marylebone Cricket Club, and the All England.

      "42 2 Tlie Ladies Edinburgh Magazine, (1705.) 'It is the advice of this meeting that Friends forbear leaving their coats and waistcoats unbuttoned from their necks downwards.' The following refer to the much controverted questions, drinking and smoking:— (1685.) 'It is the sense of this meeting that no Friend ought to go into houses that keep ale at fairs, unless they take some Elder with them.' (1691.) 'It being discovered that the common excess of smoking tobacco is inconsistent with our holy profession, this meeting adviseth that such as have occasion to make use of it, do take it privately, neither in their labour, nor employment, nor by the highways, nor in alehouses, nor elsewhere too publicly.' One of the matters respecting which the Society was formerly very rigorous, was marriage. It was considered wrong for a Friend to marry any one belonging to another denomination; he or she who desired to do so was first remonstrated with, and then, if they could not be induced to give up their intention, disowned, or separated from membership. This practice of disownment in such cases has, without doubt, been exceedingly detrimental to the Society, as it has lost many thereby who, if more gently dealt with, would have proved most useful members. During the last fifteen or twenty years this restriction on marriage has been done away with, with much benefit. Some curious minutes on this subject are to be met with in some of the old books which record the transactions of monthly meetings in former times. Here are one or two from a women's meeting in London:— (1757.) ' The Friends appointed to visit Mary Albright, report that she still persists in her resolution to many away from Friends. This meeting refers the affair to the men Friends.' 'Catherine Duck reports that she, in company with Mary Funston, had visited William Smith's servant; that the young woman seemed very tender, and not quite determined about marrying ; took their visit kindly, and would be glad of another. This meeting, therefore, requests the same Friends to continue their care over her.' They seem to have been successful in their efforts, for a little later appears the entry: ' The Friends desired to continue their care over William Smith's servant, report that they visited her again, which she received well, and told them she would endeavour to break off acquaintance with the man she had kept company with.' (1785.) 'This meeting being informed that Sarah Deane, now Impey, is lately married by a priest to a person not in membership with us, Ann Gunn and Elizabeth Allen are desired to visit her upon it and make report. It did not come to our knowledge as a meeting before it was accomplished, so as to make an appointment to visit her, but we have the satisfaction to find that she had been privately laboured with by some Friends.'\n",

' i Mary, Queen of Scots, was in prison, and her brother, the Eegent Murray, was at the height of his power. The castle was in possession of a powerful vassal of the Queen, and from his loyal adhesion to her cause had gained the enmity of the Eegent. Such a distinction was not one to be envied. The Eegent could not see a man in a position of such importance, and yet one who would not acknowledge him as master. He determined to be revenged on his enemy for having gained so much of royal favour. ' To the house, sheltered amongst all the beauties of lowland scenery, the then proprietor had brought home his bride. Scarcely more than a year previously, and there, with everything that could make life pleasant, she had watched the seasons follow one another. There, also, at last her child was born, and her happiness completed. What mattered it to her now even if her husband did leave her at times on some warlike raid ? She was no longer alone— the child needed her care. ' And so it came to pass that once more, as he had often done before, her husband left her. It was only for a few days' separation. He could safely leave his treasure hidden among the woods. But the Eegent was made aware of the fact, heard of the house only guarded by the mother and her infant, and felt his time had come.' Meta paused a moment in her narration, and the soughing wind was heard in the silence. She had told her tale with graphic force. Who shall blame me a moment afterwards, when a strange, unearthly sound struck on my ear, that my heart stood still, and a cold chill crept over me ?— ' What is that ?' My voice sounded forced, even to myself. ' Owls !' exclaimed tlie youngest of the sisters. ' Are not they nice ? We have lots of them here, and they add so to our ghostliness that we delight in them.' My heart beat again more regularly; but I could not help the hope rising that the owls would remain silent. I turned once more to Meta, and she continued. ' The Eegent lost no time in putting his plans for vengeance into effect.

There was no moon, but the stars shone, the hills closed in all round us; it was dark, only the river beside us made a sort of milky trail down the sides of the hills; and in this way, seeing nothing but the tail of the white horse that drew us (and our fortunes), we entered Annecy. Travellers, however, do not generally approach Savoy from this side. When going from Paris to Turin they only do so after having left behind them the plains of Burgundy, and the homesteads of Bresse. People ought certainly to stop at Bourg, and see the tombs of the Burgundian Dukes in the Eglise de Brou, and note the wonderful hats of the peasant women, with their horns and long lappets. All their lace comes from the neighbouring district of Velay, where the workers are very proud of their patterns, many of which have been in use since the days of Mary of Burgundy. The station at Bresse is full of coops and baskets, for Bresse exports the best poultry in the world. All its crops are devoted to this purpose, and innumerable drills of maize and millet, of potatoes and sunflowers, form the wealth of a peasantry which has a curious dialect of its own, and is proud of its industry and traditions. You are now in Savoy, and in a district anciently known as Le Bugey. Bonnivard was a native of it, though he has become so exclusively connected in our minds with Chillon that it is not usual to think of him as a Savoisien. The train now stops at Culoz, a little village in the Ehone Valley, which stands at the head of the marshes of Lazaurs. Close above it are the ruins of Virieu, and to the right is the Canal of Savieres, while to the northward opens the province of La Semille, with the vineyards of Seyssel, and the wild, rocky defile through which the waters of the Pier join the great current of the Khone. It is five o'clock, and Culoz presents a curious spectacle. Three mail trains are being made up, and the three platforms are crowded with groups of passengers. Those who stand next to us are on their way, via the tunnel of the Mont Cenis, to Turin, Brindisi, Alexandria, and Bombay. Those to the left will leach Paris to-morrow morning, and are speaking lightly of their further journey to London, or even to Edinburgh.

Perhaps any one else would have seen that he really cared for Mabel, but then he so seldom talked seriously to her. They seemed to do nothing but laugh when they were together ; and Captain Molyneux had always monopolized a good deal of Mabel's attention. Maggie wondered why she disliked the idea of Mr. Leslie's caring for Mabel so much. The room seemed stifling. Half mechanically she went to the window, opened it and leant out. How still everything was ! Not a sign of life, except a light shining in the window of the Glentyre Lodge. It reminded Ma\"\"ie that she had never been to see her old bedridden nurse. She felt thoroughly ashamed of herself. How little she did for those around her ! Even a thoughtless boy like Hector could stop his dog-cart for a minute to say a few cheery words to an old woman whom he remembered as a child. Mary Macintosh, too, was always doing little kindnesses to old Jessie, and to other sick people on the Glentyre estates; Aunt Jean's whole life was spent in thinking of others; and Mabel too, how much she did, with less opportunity than Maggie ! Aunt Jean was right; something more than book-learning was necessary to teach her to live. But then she did long so to know the meaning of everything. At that moment Maggie's life seemed to her a mystery surrounded by mysteries.

Something within her seemed to answer that perhaps, after all, the truest wisdom would be gained not by merely speculating about her fellow-creatures, but by helping those who actually came in her way. Of course it would be hard to have to abandon the wild dream of some day becoming a really clever woman, whose advice and opinion would be sought by the thinkers of the day, and who would show the world, and above all, Mr. Leslie, what a woman's brain could do;\n",

A charming little picture, graceful in subject and pleasing in execution, of a lady writing at an old-fashioned secretaire. 'Phoebe' (178), by the same artist, also deserves to be noticed. Very clever, and full of quaint humour, is ' Stone walls do not a prison make' (481), J. Watson Nicol. The colouring, too, is admirably managed. 'A Wandering Minstrel' (442), E. Herdman. This is on a larger scale than most of the other figure subjects on the walls, and the ease and slow of the lines, and simple folds of the drapery, are refreshing to the eye. The colouring is quiet and harmonious, and the girl's pensive dark eyes have something of the mute pathos of an animal in their gaze. In spite of its antiquarian research, we cannot like (424) ' Cardinal Beaton,' W. E. Lockhart. Such a lurid glare of scarlet was surely enough of itself to make the subject unmanageable. We think more might have been made of the incident in (76) ' Goldsmith in his Study,' John Faed. The faces are smoothed out of a U individuality. These are two feather-brained men of fashion, without any traces of the power and thought which must have distinguished the features both of Goldsmith and his visitor. And it was surely needless to introduce a modern diningroom chair of such uncompromising ugliness, as, towards the close of last century, chairs of a Chippendale pattern would have been the natural furniture of the room. Mr. Eobert Gavin's pictures transport us to Eastern scenes. There is not in the whole Exhibition such a delicious bit of colour as his ' Mosque Fountain' (320). It quite glows with richness, in the blue tiles round the fountain, exquisite yellow of decaying marble, and warm scarlet dress of the stooping figure. Such brilliant hues are a positive revelation to us in our greyer northern clime. Similar to this is (471) ' A Moorish Scribe,' the old man's head capitally painted.

From these cases it is impossible to hurry; the work would be worthless if half done; l)ut it is one of the trials of a nurse that the ' worst cases' in hospital phrase, namely, the most hopeless, such as paralyzed or consumptive patients, can have so little extra time spared to them. No wonder that such loud laments rise from the nurse who is told off to a burnt case; for its proper treatment would need much more time than she can spare, and the doctor attending will be little interested in it. The number of cases given to each nurse varies from eight to twelve ; and as they are in very scattered districts, the amount of walking is one of the greatest trials. As a rule, each case is seen daily, sometimes, in fever and and other cases, twice a day; and this, when one may be in a court of Marylebone and the other in Seven Dials, requires plenty of strength. At one the nurses come back to the Home for dinner. No one can appreciate the nice surroundings more thoroughly than a hospital nurse after a long morning spent among ugly sights, evil smells, dirt, and suffering; and as a rule, no people are less considered in this matter. During their working hours, the shop-girl and dressmaker have pretty things to handle and look at; the nurse has many repulsive sights and a constant strain on her nerves and spirits, and when the Avorking hours are over, the simplicity of the ward adornments are exchanged for the bareness of the 'Common-room,' where the only things on which she can six her eyes while at meals or resting are a few cheerless anatomical diagrams.

After dinner there was always a short rest in the sittingroom, where were easy-chairs, laooks, the weekly papers, and a grand piano, after which work was resumed at half-past one. We came back to tea at five, and our dresses were changed for the evening, when we could amuse ourselves.

No night work is required except in unusually bad cases. In all times and places the uniform is a complete protection; it is distinctive, without being like that of a Sister of Mercy, consisting of a short holland dress prettily made, and having a large apron and sleeves—to be worn while actually at work; a plain cloak and bonnet complete the costume. Every nurse carries with her a bag filled with the things she is likely to need—bandages, cotton-wool, plaster, linseedmeal, syringe, and thermometer. They are allowed in no case to give help, except by their work; and if they see poverty they must report the case at once to the superintendent, who will do her best to procure relief through some public charity. In many cases this is done; but the London poor are so extravagant, and particularly in the regions of St. Giles so afflicted with the ' curse of hopelessness,' that it is impossible, without close inquiry and experience, to accept their statements. Those most to be pitied are not the utterly debased population whose self-respect is gone, but rather those saddest of all cases who have seen better days. Take, for example, that old maiden lady in her one poor room, whose latter life has been a long, valiant struggle against debt and want, still surrounded with a few touching remnants of gentility. She is too proud to explain or refer to the past. The mingling of refinement and gaunt poverty seen in her poor house, combined with her intense loneliness, appeal piteously to one's heart. To such as her, and to the desolate teacher of foreign languages, with his polite manners and his threadbare attire, no city missionary or district visitor can penetrate; because they seem respectable, they cannot be ' free-breakfasted' or taken down the river on Bank holiday. But to the nurse they are well known. Even as I write, many such cases of the sadness of the shabby-genteel arise before my mind, when suffering as well as poverty come upon them as ' strong men armed.' There are now in London three Homes,—the central one in Bloomsbury Square; the second, the Js Torthern Home, at 413 Holloway Koad; the third, tlie Paddington or Marylebone Home, at 510 Edgeware Koad.

A few days later and I Maggie was once more walking along the well-known path by the river near Kilmuir. She could not bear to re-enter the Manse and see strangers in it, so she had left Mary Macintosh to pay her visit alone, and had turned down her favourite walk. It seemed like a dream to be back there again. There was the old river winding on amongst the leafless trees, just the same as it had done long ago in those happy days, whose full brightness she had never realized till the dark shadows had fallen and shut her off from them for ever. Tiiere was the big stone off which she had slipped into the water the day that Jamie caught the large trout in his hands; there was the pool into which Hector once dropped his new clasp knife; and there, too, was the roclc down which he had scrambled to get her some rowan berries. It was just at that point over there that she had first seen Mr. Leslie, and just about here that she met him the day that he proposed to Mabel. It was strange how much less she thought of those days than she had expected. She had thought that returning to these parts would recall everything; but someliow it was the earlier life with Hector and Jamie that rose the most vividly before lier in the old familiar scenes. How she missed Hector's friendship out of her life ! She had thought it wiser not to write to him; and yet, after all, perhaps she had been foolish in that as in inucli else. Might she not have continued to have him as a friend after all ? She need not have worried about him, his life had completed itself without her. She was not needed by him now any more than by any one else.

He was followed in 1824 by the only daughter, Maximiliana Wilhelmina Augusta Sophia Mary, who was eleven years old when their mother died; and shortly afterwards their father formed a morganatic marriage. The court of Darmstadt had imbibed philosophical opinions during its long connection with France, and a German girl as a rule learns very little of theology till she is prepared for her confirmation, when a year is often devoted to religious instruction. This ceremony and instruction was usually delayed with German princesses, in case the prospect of a Romanist or Greek Catholic suitor should appear, as it would make the change of faith less difficult if the mind in that respect was a blank; and consequently, when the Princess Mary of Darmstadt went to St. Petersburg six months before her marriage to be instructed ia the faith of the Eusso-Greek Church, preparatory to her rebaptism (which is required in the case of a Lutheran), she embraced it with all the ardour of a young and serious character who had no preconceived opinions to be opposed. In 1838 the Crown Prince of Eussia, afterwards Alexander II., was sent abroad for the benefit of his health and spirits, which had suffered from the very rigorous mode of life and severe studies that his father had imposed upon him, and in which a minimum of time was allowed for rest and refreshment. The Marquis de Custine, who met him at Ems, calls him ' one of the finest models of a prince that I have ever met with. The habitual expression of his face is gentleness and benevolence; but between the youthful smile of the eyes and the constant contraction of the mouth, there is nevertheless a discordance wliich perhaps indicates some inward suffering. One can observe that he is under the influence of some cause of grief; his eyelids are cast down with a sadness that betrays the cares of a riper age. His carriage is graceful, imposing, and altogether princely, and his manner modest without being timid.' The Prince was then nineteen ; and two years later, the Czar being anxious that he should marry, sent him to pay a visit to the court of Baden, where the present Duchess of Saxe-Coburg was the eldest unmarried princess, and being about twenty, was regarded by the Czar as very suitable for the future Empress. But at Frankfort, where he was first to rest for two or three days, the Prince received an invitation to visit the castle of Darmstadt, and there saw the Princess Mary, who was his mother's second cousin, and only sixteen years old.

Her short residence in England was not fortunate, as the weather was wet and foggy, and most unfavourable for an invalid; and after one or two drives, she was laid up with bronchitis for the rest of her visit. Two of her sons escorted her as far as Paris, where she was joined by her younger children, who accompanied her to Nice ; and she showed herself a careful mother by making the two elder princes promise that, after her departure, they would not remain more than a night in Erance. That occasion was her last and first visit to this country, although it is believed to have been her daughter's great wish to entertain her at Eastwell Park, where rooms had been purposely arranged for her, and never occupied by any one else. The marriage of the Duchess of Edinburgh had naturally given the Empress a great interest in this country: she understood the language, and kept herself acquainted with its literature; and in later years her greatest enjoyment was probably derived from the visits of her daughter and grandchildren to Pussia. Like most German princesses, she was an accomplished needlewoman, and in the travelling saloon in which she undertook her long railway journeys, a work-table was a conspicuous object. The Empresses of Russia have always been patronesses of several educational and charitable institutions in St. Petersburg, but with her this was no sinecure, for she was personally acquainted with every school-girl and governess in the establishments nominally under her care.

Though she really liked Ian Leslie, finding him an agreeable companion, a good-natured and considerate host, and seeing that he was a very devoted husband ; yet there was something incomplete in his life: blameless as it seemed, it gave her a sense of wasted energy and unemployed powers. Mabel's nature, on the other hand, appeared to have found its completion, and to centre itself entirely on her husband and children. When love touched the chords of her being, it did indeed seem as if it ' Smote the chord of self that trembling passed in music out of sight.' But neither culture and artistic tastes, nor love and home interests, seemed to Maggie as if they constituted a sufficient aim and object to absorb every part of the more complicated machinery of a man's nature, and she could not help thinking that the riches that render work unnecessary may often be rather a curse than a blessing. What a contrast Leslie's artificial existence was to Hector's simple, practical life, that seemed so satisfactory in every way! That man walking down St. James' Street in front of her, really was not unlike Hector; he was about the same height, and swung his stick just in the same way. Was it possible tliat Hector could be in town ? He might be passing through London to join his mother and Lady Susan in France, and for a moment Maggie's pulses beat quicker. But no ! The man turning round at this instant, revealed a face as unlike Hector's as face could be, and Maggie could only laugh at her own folly. She would much rather have visited some of the great sights of the modern Babylon than have gone, day after day, to inspect collections of china, or to listen to classical music. But neither Mabel nor Leslie could in the least realize the feelings of any one seeing London for the first time. They expected her to enter into all their interests, and with anything beyond that circle they had but little sympathy. On her return from Christie's, Maggie found, to her surprise, a letter awaiting her in her sister's handwriting. Mary Mackintosh was famed in her family for a dishke of letter-writing. What could she want ? ' Oh, Mabel, how dreadful! I don't know wliat to do. Tiiere has been such a terrible accident at Balnagoonie. Poor Hector slipped on the ice at the curling match last week, and he has injured himself internally. He is laid up there.\n",

Besides, Aunt Jean is ill too ; she has been in bed some days with one of her bad attacks. How I wish that I had not started so soon! I really think that I ought to go back at once.' ' Oh no, Maggie ; you mustn't hurry away from us. That would be too bad. No doubt Mary Mackintosh exaggerates everything. She always was so fussy if there was anything the matter. Depend upon it, Aunt Jean would be all right again by the time you could get there. Her attacks never last long. And as to the man, why can't his own people look after him ?' ' You see, his mother, Lady Lucy Macdonald, is abroad now, and he has no near relations.' ' Macdonald ! Oh yes, to be sure ; I remember. Why, it's the red-haired boy about whom we always used to laugh at you. How very romantic! If you go back and nurse him, you'll have to marry him, you know. Mind you ask me to the wedding.' 'Hector Macdonald is engaged to Lady Susan Gordon, Lord Glentyre's daughter,' said Maggie stif Hy, ' and she is travelling with his mother now.' ' Of course! Macdonald; that was the name. I heard something about it last season. No doubt, if he's really dangerously ill, she's posting back as fast as trains can carry her. No, no, Maggie; don't you be Quixotic, and go racing off after people who probably don't want you. Besides, if you do go and save his life, he'll think himself obliged to throw over Lady Susan and marry you. What an awkward predicament for the poor man! You'd much better come ([uietly down to Barnard with us. If they want you, they can always send for you. I shall take you to the Court Theatre to see the Ladies Battle. That will show you what to expect if you go.' Why has no philosopher yet written a treatise on the potential power of chaff? Tew things exercise a deeper intluence over human destiny, yet'how utterly unconscious people seem of the responsibility they may sometimes incur by a few random words spoken in jest. Chaff always has seemed to me one of the greatest of the uncalculated forces at work in the world.

So she contented herself by writing to her sister, that ' if Aunt Jean were really dangerously ill, and required trained nursing, she would endeavour to return to them, and she hoped that they would soon let her know how both the invalids were.' But day after day went slowly and drearily by, and there was still no letter from Scotland. At length the day of Lady Amelia Sitruth's party arrived, and Maggie found herself, for the first time in her life, introduced into London society. She had pleasant neighbours at dinner. On one side of her was a learned divine, on the other a rising young artist; but Maggie was sore at heart, and unable to throw herself thoroughly into any conversation, however agreeable. She was wondering wearily all the time why she had not heard from Scotland again, how Hector and Aunt Jean were, whether any one was helping Mary to nurse them, and if they missed her at Balnagoonie. Too preoccupied with these thoughts for real conversation, and not suificiently well acquainted with the circles in which her companions moved to keep up a mechanical slow of surface talk, she continually relapsed into silence, and Mabel, watching her from the other side of the table, could not help wondering why Maggie, who was so clever herself, did not get on better with clever people. After dinner, Maggie was surprised to find how rapidly the room filled; in spite of Mabel's assurance that London was empty, nearly two hundred people shortly assembled in Lady Amelia's drawing-room. Mrs. Leslie Barnard soon discovered one or two stray acquaintances, who, like herself, were rather surprised to find themselves in such company, and did their best to atone for their presence by sitting in a little group, whispering disparaging remarks about the extraordinary appearance of the rest of the people, and wondering who they could all be. Occasionally joining this group, and trying hard to look as if they belonged to it, were some of those professional toadies who linger on the outskirts of society, and find it easier to extort an occasional scrap of civility from Mrs. Grundy when most of her real votaries are out of town. Meanwhile, Mr. Leslie and a lady, who was dressed according to the most advanced rules of high art, were deep in a discussion about bric-a-brac. In the inner room beyond, a well-known composer was playing a \"weird interlude of his own composition, but the noise of tongues was unhushed except in the immediate neighbourhood of the piano.

Second, IRRLICHT, with a very good answer. LINDA, GRETA, and PINK all good. Give a short outline of the career of Marlborough. John Churchill, the son of a Devonshire squire, was born in ICoO. He began life in the Royal Guards of Charles II., and after five years' service in France under Marshal Turenne, was promoted to the colonelcy of an English regiment in the service of France. James, Duke of York, was his first patron, and to him he remained faithful after his accession, and during the rebellion of Monmouth. Here his fidelity ended, for on the arrival of William of Orange, Churchill deserted to him. Created Earl of Marlborough by his new master, he did good service in Ireland, but his restless mind was not long content with this allegiance. Througli his wife, Sarah Jennings, he had obtained great influence over the Princess Anne, and he now schemed to rouse the Tories against William and Mary, and give the crown to his patroness. The plot was discovered, and, stripped of his honours, the disgraced Churchill at once opened communications with the exiled James. But, though thus untrustworthy, Marlborough was recognised by William as the one captain fitted by his military genius to break the power of France, and recommended by him to his successor as her Captain-General. In 1702 began Marlborough's great military career—a career of unbroken success as regards enterprises of his own devising, beginning with the capture of the Dutch fortresses, and followed by the later victories of Blenheim, Ramillies, and Malplaquet. But the war was unpopular and languishing to a close ; and the action of parties variously perplexed and embroiled, issued finally in the dismissal of Marlborough from all his employments in 1712, when he retired to the Continent. The accession of George I. recalled him to his dignities, ■which he enjoyed till his death on June 8, 1722. APIS. State some of the causes of ambiguity of terms, and illustrate.

' Yes, true; but my ambition was not that he should be given up to the life he has lately seemed to look forward to—in a monastery turning over musty books, but that he should be known in society. I should have liked that he should be a great preacher, his words listened to by the great and poor throughout the land. He is made for something better than to muse over Latin classics with the Abbot of St. Vandrille.' ' It was good of the abbot to let him go.' ' Good ! he could not retain him against his will.' ' I think Pierre Avould have stayed if the abbot had desired him. I am thankful he did not. After a while Jean and Pierre will pull well together, though I see that just now Jean thinks it a little unfair that Pierre should be set over him.' ' Jean has far too much confidence in himself. Of course Pierre must be first after you. It is quite absurd of Jean if he thinks it could be otherwise.'

IT was on a raw, chill evening in early spring, that Mrs. Linn and her four daughters—Alice, Ehoda, Fanny, and Mary —drove up their own avenue on their return home after a three years' sojourn on the Continent. The trees were scarcely coming into leaf, and the backwardness of the season contrasted unfavourably in the eyes of the travellers with the verdure and sunshine they had left across the Channel; a feeling approaching to depression crept over them as they noted how the budding foliage was nipped by the east wind, and they shiveringiy drew their wraps closer round them. Nor was the aspect of things within doors more attractive. The house was a good one, well-sized and commodious, standing in its own grounds, and situated in a\n",

      "The Trial of Taste : A Sketch. 405 pleasant country district nine miles from London; but the furniture was old-fashioned and shabby. It was years since any money had been laid out, save on the most necessary repairs; the plan of re-furnishing entirely, which Mr. Linn had intended to carry out as soon as his children were grown up, remained unfulfilled owing to his death and the subsequent residence of the family abroad; while the tenants to whom the house had been let, thinking probably that there was little worth taking care of, had knocked things about unmercifully. Mrs. Linn even was struck by the extreme plainness and shabbiness of her 'old home; and if she felt something of surprise and disappointment, how much stronger was the impression produced on the young girls! They looked round with undisguised dissatisfaction, and ran from room to room seeking in vain for one that was habitable according to their ideas. ' How ugly everything is !' exclaimed Alice. ' These chairs look as if they came out of the ark,' remarked Mary, ' and the cushions are all moth-eaten.' ' What hideous papers !' said Rhoda. ' What faded old carpets !' added Fanny. All in chorus, ' What a pity we came home!' Mrs. Linn had felt too much in sympathy with her daughters' strictures to dissent, but this last lamentation roused her to interpose: ' Oh no! you must not say so. Home is home, and soon we shall have things very different; we are going to re-furnish the house entirely. Your dear father always intended doing so, and there is a sum of money in the bank appropriated to the purpose. This is all that is wanted to make the house charming. The rooms are well-sized, and there are so many that you will each be able to have a separate bed-room.' The girls were comforted; they had sense to see that an evil for which the remedy is apparent is not worth grumbling about; and full of hope and anticipation, they made the dingy rooms bright with their merriment the first evening. But many days had not passed before Mrs. Linn became aware of a threatened trouble not so easy to remove as the shabby furniture. The constant amusement and variety afforded by the life they had been leading, made the quiet routine of an English country neighbourhood seem to the girls dull by comparison. The mother had little fear that when once they were really settled, and got interested in different occupations, they would be happy and cheerful, but it would take, she knew, some little time to renew asso-\n",

A bright idea occurred to Mrs. Linn to supply them at once with employment and an interest. Calling them all round her, she said : 'We have now to begin the work of furnishing, and I intend to allow each of you to superintend the doing-up of your own room. It will relieve me of some trouble, for I shall have a great deal to attend to. I shall make a calculation, and tell you how much you may expend, which sum you must be careful not to exceed ; but the responsibility of laying it out will rest with yourselves.' 'Do you mean,' said Ehoda, the second girl, her eyes brightening,' that we may furnish our rooms as we like, to our own taste ?' ' Yes, that is what I mean you to do; on certain points you must refer to me, such as the quality and price of things of which you are no judge, but further than that I shall not interfere.' ' What sun it will be !' exclaimed Alice; and her sisters seemed to be of the same opinion. ' I will have the prettiest room of you all,' said Fanny. ' You must each try to excel,' observed Mrs. Linn. ' And you will be umpire, mamma ?' said Alice. ' Not exactly; your own votes must decide the question. I will accept the casting vote if you like, in the event of difference of opinion.' ' It will make it much more interesting,' observed Ehoda, ' if we agree not to see each other's rooms until they are all completed. I will not look into yours if you promise not to come into mine.' The compact was readily made, and Mrs. Linn, looking round with pleasure on their animated faces, from which all signs of languor had vanished, said: ' To stimulate you, and make it still more interesting, I promise a prize of £5 for whichever room is the greatest success.' ' This becomes exciting,' observed Ehoda. ' One point I must caution you on,' said Mrs. Linn, ' which is not to spend an undue portion of the sum at your disposal on embellishments, and forget something essential.' ' No, no,' said Mary, ' we will not lay out half our money on an ornamental clock for the mantle-piece, and forget the chest of drawers.'\n",

      "The Trial of Taste: A Sketch. 407 ' No,' rejoined their mother,' you are not children, and I have more confidence in you than to expect you to be so silly. Well, I shall go into London to-morrow'— ' Oh, mamma,' interrupted Fanny,' do let me go with you.' ' That is probably the wish of your sisters also, Fanny,' answered Mrs. Linn with a smile, for Fanny was always the one to put herself forward. ' However, you will all have abundant opportunity of selecting your furniture, for I shall have occasion to go frequently to town either by rail or in the carriage, and one of you can always accompany me; and sometimes you can go with Evans. She is a very good judge of the price and quality of carpets, bedding, and such things, better than I am myself, and will see that you get proper value for your money.' ' I have decided already the style in which I intend to furnish my room,' remarked Alice, who for the last few minutes had been smiling to herself over what, let us hope, was a very pretty picture. ' You had better not tell us about it,' suggested Mary, ' in case we steal some of your ideas.' ' I have plenty of ideas of my own,' retorted Ehoda, ' I don't need to steal or borrow from any one. So now, I shall get paper and a pencil, and draw out a sort of design.' ' I am not going to hamper myself with styles and designs,' remarked Fanny,' I only mean to make my room lovely.' The following morning Mrs. Linn went into London, and took Fanny with her. The latter, as she parted from her sisters, remarked: ' I am not bent on making purchases to-day; I may, perhaps, only look about me. I do not mean to take anything but what I really like and admire, so, unless I see things exceptionally pretty, I shall not be tempted, and will wait.' Her mother went to consult an upholsterer, and while she was thus engaged Fanny amused herself looking round the large shop. A set of bed-room stoneware attracted her eye. It was very handsome both in design and colouring, clusters of westeria on a cream-coloured ground, relieved by a purple and gilt border an inch wide. ' Mamma,' said she, ' I have been looking at the prettiest stoneware set I ever saw; I should like it for my room so much.' 'Well,' replied her mother, 'you can take it, you know, if it is not too expensive, and if you are sure it is suitable.' It was a somewhat expensive set, but well worth the money, Fanny said to herself; and having secured it, her\n",

If you like to look at bed-room papers, Fanny,—I am not ready yet,—you might see one that pleased you.' The choice of her paper was a very interesting task, and in this also Fanny was successful. After many pieces had been unrolled before her fastidious eyes, she met with one which pleased her greatly; the shopman described it as a French paper,' very select.' She returned home well satisfied with her day, and exclaimed to her sisters as they met in the hall, ' I have got the start of you all, I have chosen a lovely paper, and the prettiest set for my washstand you ever saw.' Now followed a busy time indeed, during great part of which the house was in the condition understood by the popular phrase, turned inside out. Mrs. Liun had her hands full, and we are bound to say she did not meet with much assistance from her daughters, who were all engrossed in their own share of the common labour. In the eyes of Alice, Ehoda, Fanny, and Mary, the furnishing even of the drawingroom, let alone less interesting portions of the house, was as nothing compared to the adornment of those four little chambers of which they had, respectively, the entire charge and responsibility. They adhered to their resolution not to see each other's work while in progress, and a profound mystery was observed in each case. Articles of furniture were, of course, visible at the moment of arrival, but they were usually concealed by matting or other coverings ; Alice brought into the drawing-room heaps of white muslin and rose-coloured ribbon, strongly suggestive of toilet decorations, and Khoda every evening devoted herself to the production of ' antique' lace, a work just then in great vogue, by means of linen tape and thread; but no qviestions were asked, nor comments made. There was one exception to this reticence, viz., on the part of Fanny, who was often so delighted with her own purchases that she could not refrain from repeating, ' My room will be the prettiest, you will see; I fully expect to gain the prize.' There were so many details to be carried out, so many finiahing touches required, that the rest of the house was almost brought into order before these all-important rooms were ready. The chill English spring had given place to\n",

' I spent all, or very nearly all, the money you allowed,' said Alice, who looked greatly pleased with her mother's commendation. ' So I suppose, and I wished you to do so. Your things are all good. That is a delightful little wardrobe. At the same time, the room owes its effect, not to the upholsterer, but to the taste you have shown in the details. One thing suits another, and the result is a harmonious whole.' ' I have always heard,' remarked Mary, looking dubiously at the baskets, ' that plants in a bed-room are very injurious to health.' ' On the contrary,' exclaimed Ehoda, ' that is an exploded idea. Plants in a room are particularly conducive to health, except one or two kinds. Do you not know that they consume carbonic acid gas in the air, and give out oxygen, which is what we require ?' ' But I thought,' pursued Mary, looking appealingly at her mother, ' that at night plants reverse that process ? I am sure,' in a rather aggrieved tone, ' I have read that such is the case.' ' I have read something of the kind too, Mary,' replied Mrs. Linn, ' but I am not sure it is an authentic fact. At any rate, I should require to be well convinced that these few ferns could be injurious to health before I condemned Alice's pretty baskets.' ' My poor baskets,' said Alice, laughing—' I never thought of carbonic acid gas, or oxygen either, when I instituted them ; I merely thought of making my room pretty. But enough of mine for the present, we must see Ehoda's now ; do the honours, Ehoda.' The two rooms opened off each other, the door of communication having been kept jealously locked until the present moment. It was now opened, and as the party passed through, the contrast was something like that which is felt on going from the outer sunshine into a medieeval chapel or a library. The colouring was all toned down; but we must describe the room, and let our readers judge for themselves. It was so arranged as to appear as much a sitting-room as a bedroom. The bed, a small brass one without a canopy, was placed against the wall, to occupy as little space as possible; the counterpane was of a richly-coloured fabric, which, though probably of English manufacture, had an Oriental appearance. The floor was stained a deep brown,\n",

      "The Trial of Taste: A Sketch. 411 and polished about two feet from the wainscot all round ; the centre of the room was carpeted with a large soft Persian rug. The toilet table was furnished with many little drawers, in which the dressing apparatus could be put out of sight; the washstand could be opened or closed, in which latter case it looked like a small table, and on it was placed the water jug. To this purpose Ehoda had appropriated a large earthenware vessel such as Italian women use for carrying water, and which, in the course of their travels, had been bought for a few pence, for the sake of its graceful design, for it was of the commonest clay. The mantle-piece, which was only of wood painted, was covered with green cloth edged with fringe, and on it, as well as on one or two carved brackets, were disposed the various nick-nacks which Khoda had accumulated,—a bit of Swiss carving, a specimen or two of Venetian glass, a statuette in terra cotta, etc. The prospect from the windows was not so pretty as in Alice's room, and they were judiciously veiled, but the drapery was pretty and added to the general effect; it was of a creamy tint, and formed of strips of' guipure,' produced by Ehoda's industrious fingers, alternating with strips of linen. A small oak bookcase contained, though it was not filled by, Ehoda's little library; a basket of fresh flowers graced a gipsy table, and was a focus of bright colour which pleased the eye, and contrasted, while it harmonized with, the subdued tones of the furniture. ' This is artistic, Ehoda,' said Mrs. Linn, looking round. In fact Ehoda had profited much by her foreign tour, and had acquired more culture of taste than might have been apparent had not this opportunity been aftbrded her of giving practical shape to her ideas. In the furnishing of this little room Ehoda's mind found expression. ' This must have been a very expensive room, I should think,' remarked Mary,—criticism the first. ' No, it was not,' was the reply, ' one expense saved another; for instance, the small cost of staining the floor, and it was not much, was more than made up by the saving on the carpet. This large Persian rug cost only £1, 15s.' ' My first impression was that the room was sombre,' observed Alice, ' but it grows upon one. I think I should like it more and more the longer I stayed. There is a feeling of repose and harmony about it. Mamma, do you like it better than mine ?' ' I can scarcely compare rooms in such different styles,' was the reply; ' it really is a question to be decided by\n",

Were I a young girl, occupied with just the things of the moment, especially when I was dressing for a party, I might feel the atmosphere of Alice's room most congenial; but were I inclined to read or in a thoughtful mood, Rhoda's would be a sitting study or even oratory. I think,' she added, smiling, and by way of illustration, ' if anything could inspire me to write a book, it would be these surroundings.' ' I hope, then, you will make use of my room, mamma,' laughed Ehoda. ' I should feel such a room as this a responsibility,' remarked Alice; ' it would be an effort to me to live up to the level of my artistic furniture.' ' To talk of living up to the level of your furniture, Alice ! What nonsense!' exclaimed Fanny. ' Would it be amiss, Alice, to have before you an artistic ideal, to which you felt you had to live up, as you say,' asked Mrs. Linn, ' even though it did cost your indolence an effort ?' Alice only laughed. Attention was now drawn by Fanny, somewhat disparagingly, to the plainness of the paper, which was of a saint, intangible shade of green, with scarcely any pattern. ' I hope by and by to get a few pictures to hang up,' explained Ehoda, ' and I chose the paper that would set them off best.' ' I have got some pictures framed and hung up already,' rejoined Fanny, then abruptly stopped. ' Mamma,' said Ehoda, ' there is something about my mantle-piece which does not satisfy me.' ' I see what you mean,' said Mrs. Linn; ' there is a defect. Do you not perceive what it is ?' ' No, I do not,' answered Ehoda; ' I have changed the ornaments, and puzzled myself trying to find out.' ' Do any of you see the defect ?' asked Mrs. Linn. ' I don't admire the mantle-piece,' said Mary, ' but I cannot name any particular defect.' ' Now, do not you see,' said Mrs. Linn, addressing them all, ' that the green of the cloth is a great deal too bright ? It puts everything else out. Let us try how this will look.' She took from her neck a sage-green tie, and spread it over the mantle-piece in contact with the coloured ornaments. The improved effect was apparent, and Ehoda was delighted. ' How stupid I was !' she exclaimed. ' In theory I know perfectly the value of those subdued tints, yet I actually, in\n",

What a pretty paper, Fanny '— ' But,' put in Alice, ' Ehoda chose more judiciously. A paper with less pattern would show off your pictures to greater advantage; they seem here mutually to spoil each other.' ' I chose the paper before I thought of putting up pictures,' Fanny admitted. ' This ought to be in my room,' said Ehoda, pouncing on a carved oak chair. ' I am very proud of that chair,' said Fanny; ' it is really antique and artistic' ■ ' But you have nothing else artistic or antique in your room,' objected Ehoda; ' it is out of place.' ' This is a poor chest of drawers, Fanny,' remarked Mrs. Linn; ' both the wood and the workmanship are inferior. Not a good investment, my dear.' ' I know it is not,' said Fanny, ' but the fact is, I had spent so much on the carpet, and one or two other articles, that I was obliged to save on something.' ' Some of your furniture is of birch and some mahogany, which looks very patchy,' said Mary. Fanny had borne the accumulated strictures with tolerable equanimity, but now her temper gave way. ' You are all very disagreeable !' cried she to her sisters. ' Mamma, I appeal to you as to whether my things, with the exception of the chest of drawers, are not very pretty and superior.' ' Yes, my dear, they are individually very nice, but—well, we ought not to discuss the rooms until we have seen them all, then we can compare notes. Mary, we will go on to yours.' She was moving towards the door when Mary put herself in the way. ' I have furnished my room on a different plan from any of the others,' said she. ' I admit that Alice's is very pretty, though I do think those fallals of white muslin will cost no end of trouble to wash and get up; and Ehoda's is artistic, but I have not gone in for any of that sort of thing, I don't see the use of it'— ' Let me pass, please,' interrupted Ehoda.

' I wanted to prepare you in case of disappointment,' replied Mary,' and that you might do me justice.' She led the way and ushered in the party. It was just a bed-room, as one of the girls remarked, in which, if there was nothing to please, there was as little to offend the eye. The iron bedstead was suitable as to size, and well placed, and Mary, turning down the bedclothes, surmounted by a white Marseilles quilt, called on her mother to inspect the excellent spring mattress. There was a commodious wardrobe, which looked rather too large for the room; everything, in short, was useful, plain, substantial. ' What an ugly room!' was Ehoda's unceremonious stricture. ' There is an absence of beauty, rather,' corrected Alice. Mary did not seem the least hurt, for her mother said at almost the same moment,' You have not wasted your money, Mary, I must say.' ' I could not stand such a toilet table as that,' observed Alice, ' bare painted legs, and a common little white cover on the top.' ' I don't care for a toilet table dressed up like a lady for a ball,' replied its owner; ' I prefer to get the use of a draw\"er.' ' You have a fine wardrobe,' remarked Mrs. Linn. * It was expensive,' said Mary,' though it is only painted ; it left me little money for superfluities; but a good wardrobe is such a comfort. I don't think, Ehoda, that your carved bureau will hold your dresses well.' ' No, it does not,' answered Ehoda, ' I forgot to show you the contrivance I have for my dresses. Come back and see it.' They returned to Ehoda's room, where she drew aside a curtain which concealed a recess, and showed a row of pegs on which to hang cloaks and other articles; then she removed the cushion from a long low seat against the wall, near the fireplace, lifted the top and discovered a receptacle in which her best dresses lay nearly full length. ' This is ingenious, I own,' said Mary. ' It was a packing-case which I got out of the lumberroom, and took the liberty of appropriating,' explained Ehoda. ' Now,' said Mrs. Linn, ' we have seen all the rooms, so we may pass judgment, and decide who is worthy of the prize.' ' Mamma,' said Fanny, ' before we go further I have something to say. I confess that my room is a failure.'\n",

' Moreover, I fear it has cost more than any of the others,' pursued Fanny, speaking with an evident effort, ' for I took everything of the best and handsomest, so it really is vexatious for me.' ' Do not be discouraged,' replied her mother. ' It has been said that our failures may be the steps by which we mount upwards. It signifies very little, even from an artistic point of view, that your first experiment in the domain of taste has miscarried, but it is a great thing to know and admit that you have failed.' ' But now, can anything be done to improve my room ?' asked Fanny with a humility which, contrasting with her former boastful assurance, was quite touching. ' I think,' replied her mother, ' that I must take one or two of your things which are most incongruous off your hands for some of the bedrooms which are not yet completely furnished, and we may make some exchanges which will be advantageous to you.' Fanny thanked her mother; and Mary said: ' I am willing, for my own part, that the prize should be allotted to either Alice or Ehoda; but I want you to admit, mamma, that I had as much a design in the furnishing of my room as they had.' 'You had,' replied her mother, 'the design of making it very comfortable.' ' And is that a small thing ?' asked Mary. ' If a bedroom is comfortable and neat, it is surely immaterial whether it is more or less pretty.' ' I am not so sure, Mary, that it can be immaterial whether morning after morning our eyes open on objects which are pretty and graceful, or such as are altogether commonplace. Our taste not only forms our surroundings, but is insensibly formed by them,—the style of the rooms we live in, the dress we wear; and indirectly, I believe, these things act on the character also.' 'And comfort,' interrupted Ehoda, 'does not necessarily imply the sacrifice of beauty; Alice and I will sleep as soundly in our pretty beds as you will in that japanned iron thing of yours.' ' I foresee that we shall not arrive at our decision without some debate,' observed Mrs. Linn,' so I shall sit down in this very inviting low chair. I am afraid you are inclined to be luxurious, Ehoda.' At that moment a servant tapped at the door: ' It is four o'clock, will you take tea, ma'am ?'\n",

      "The Trial of Taste: A Sketch. 417 ' Oh, let it be brought up here,' said one of the girls. Mrs. Linn assented, and while Ehoda brought forward her gipsy table to receive the tray, Alice ran out of the room. She returned in a few minutes, saying, ' In honour of the occasion, I have ordered the new French tea-set that we have never yet used ;' and as she spoke she held up a very pretty little table-cloth, embroidered with a wreath of forgetme-nots in crewels, which had been worked during the previous winter, and reserved for high days. All this caused a diversion, nor was the subject of discussion immediately resumed as they gathered round the tea-table. The pretty room, the pretty china, the pretty tablecloth, gave to the afternoon tea that day an air of being en file ; the cream seemed to pour more riclily than usual, the tea to have a more refined flavour, the bread and butter to be more delicate. ' After all,' remarked Mrs. Linn, ' it was nonsense getting out these things, and bringing them up here. It would have saved trouble to have had the tea-tray placed on the table in the old school-room.' ' Oh, mamma, it would not have been half so nice/ said Mary. 'Why, Mary,* said Mrs. Linn, 'the tea and bread and butter would have been the same.' Mary looked very significant as she said, ' Ah! mamma, you are laying a trap for me, but I will not fall into it.' ' Your own remark only shows, Mary, that with all your utilitarianism, you have an sesthetical side to your nature, which asserts itself, however much you may starve it. And remember, that for every faculty you stunt in yourself,— every talent you fail to cultivate,—you are so much the poorer, and your sources of pleasure so much the more meagre. In nature we see harmonious development, beauty, and utility combined, not the purely utilitarian principle exemplified.' ' Except in potatoes and turnips,' suggested Alice. ' Very well, Mary shall have the potato and turnip as her emblem if she pleases,' said her mother with a smile. Mary looked disappointed; she had expected that her pre-eminently 'sensible' room would have been viewed with unqualified approbation (at any rate by her mother), and perhaps rewarded with the prize. Mrs. Linn pursued: ' Do not misunderstand me. I do not for a moment mean that we should subordinate utility to No. 69.—SEPTEMBEE 1880. 2 D\n",

We shall not suspect you of partiality, and none of us can becomingly vote it to ourselves.' ' Very well,' said Mrs. Linn, ' I consider that the prize lies between Alice and Ehoda. Between their respective claims I really cannot decide, as each has been successful in the style she adopted. I therefore propose to divide the sum, and give £2, 10s. to each.' We are happy to be able to state that on this judgment Fanny and Mary gentlj^ clapped their hands, showing that, though there was competition, there was not envy among them. Mrs. Linn produced a pretty little purse, containing five sovereigns. ' If I had anticipated this result,' said she,' I should have provided two purses.' She gave £2, 10s. to Ehoda, as the younger, then handed the purse, containing the same sum, to Alice. ' If you like,' said she,' you may each buy a little timepiece for your rooms.' ' That would be very nice,' said Ehoda, ' but I would rather spend the money on material for painting my door.' ' And I have an ambition too, mamma,' said Alice. ' I want to learn to paint on china, and I will appropriate my prize-money to procuring some materials and a book of instructions. If I succeed, I will paint you some plates and tiles, Ehoda; for you deserve contributions.' ' Learn to paint on glass too, Alice,' suggested Ehoda, ' and paint my window. I am so fond of coloured glass.' ' Painting on glass,' observed Mrs. Linn, ' is not so suitable for amateurs. However, I do not say. Set limits to your ambition; I only say, One step at a time.' ' Oh! mamma,' exclaimed Alice,' what a splendid mother you are ! You encourage us so much.' And so we leave our young people, entering on a new chapter of their youth. That it will prove a happy period, that there will be no more regrets for having returned to a settled home life, we venture to predict, for we leave them supplied with sources of interesting occupation, and therein lies, in a great measure, the secret of happiness.\n",

' There or there,' she said, indicating two doors. * Will you tell him I must see him ?' ' I dare not go to Madame's room while she is in such grief.' ' I must see M. Pierre.' 'Well, I wi U find him.' Very nervously Therese softly opened the door of the room wherein lay the dead. All was silent and still, no living being was there. Therfese crossed herself, muttered,' Mary, save his soul,' and in yet more awe went to seek her young master in his mother's room. She listened at the door, there was no sound ; she noiselessly turned the handle, the room was half dark, for it was now dusk light. Therese could distinguish two figures sitting silently side by side. She advanced a little into the room, and perceived that Madame Le Vieil was asleep, holding her son's hand. Thdrese approached close and said : ' Henri Maget says he must see you now.' Pierre gently withdrew his hand from that of the exhausted sleeper, and followed Therese out of the room. ' M. Pierre,' Maget said, ' you know I would not trouble you on this day if I could help it, and I have to grieve you too.' ' Say quickly what you have to say, Maget.' ' I came here about two hours ago to ask if I could be of any service. No one was about, and I went into the kitchen to see if Nanette was there; then I heard footsteps in the shop above, which astonished me ; I went to the door and tried to open it, it was fastened on the inside. Knowing that the shutters were up, and the door to the street locked, I suspected something wrong, and called out \" Who is there ? if you do not open the door I wi U burst it in.\" No one answered, and I did burst it in. There appeared to be no one in the room, but the key was left in the back of Madame's drawer. I locked the drawer, there is the key. I looked a U about, and at length heard a deep-drawn breath from behind the stove. In the hollow place there I found M. Louis; he came out and offered me money if I would say nothing. I left him in the shop and locked the door, that is the key.' Pierre looked bewildered; he hardly took in the gist of Henri's words, though he saw that the man was excited. ' Louis was behind the stove. I think I will call Jean, Maget.' Jean was called, and Henri repeated his story, and then went away, leaving the brothers together.

' You dear old thing, of course I do not want to see my father's wife; she has a loud voice and red hair, and I wouldn't like her if I could; but I should like to see La Tour. I should like to see the green fields, and my father, and old Christophe the shepherd, and Babette his wife. What is the matter ? Why do you look so scandalized, Claire ?' ' It does seem so odd of you, Marie, to say your father's wife has a loud voice and red hair. I do not think you ought to speak in that way.' ' Perhaps I oughtn't, dear, but she has, all the same. Victorine, you little love, how sleepy you are getting ; here is Nanette. Good-night, little one.' Victorine and little Michel made a tour, wishing goodnight and giving kisses, till they came to brother Pierre; then all the others kept silence, while, kneeling down and clasping their hands, the two children prayed 'the good God to take care of the soul of dear father, to make us good children, and watch over all we love.' Still kneeling, they repeated the hymn: ' Heart of the Holy Child, Hide me in Thee ; Purest and undefiled, Purify me ; Joy of my holy life, Far from evil passions rise, Troubling this world of strife, Keep me with Thee. ' Sweet child of Bethlehem, Open Thine heart; Lessons from Nazareth Deign to impart. : Mary and Joseph dear, . Lat iis be to Jesus near ; With you we shall not fear From Him to part.'\n",

Then Pierre picked up Victorine and carried her to Nanette; but the child would not be put down, and began a long whispering in his ear. ' I have been a good girl all day, brother Pierre,—carry me up-stairs,—except once, I forgot, I did slap Michel because he trod on Eosalie and made sawdust blood come out of her.' ' What are you saying, Victorine ? Do not tease Pierre, he has much to think of,' said Madame. ' I know what you want, Victorine,' said Leonard, ' shall I do?' ' No, you won't do, but I will take you to-night,' said the little tyrant, and the stout Leonard proceeded to mount to le denier 4tage with his little sister in his arms and Micliel clinging on to his back.

When the Sunday upon which the Octive of Corpus Christi fell came, Pierre was unable to accompany his mother to the Cemetery of St. Medard. While preparing colours in the heated furnace room on the previous Saturday evening, he had been seized by an attack, caused by a rush of blood to the head. Jean had found him almost insensible and helped him into a cool room. Pierre soon revived and regained self-possession. A doctor who had been sent for, looking grave, ordained as much rest as possible, and perfect quiet for the following day. On Sunday, Pierre seemed much as usual, and was so distressed at the idea of Madame Le Vieil postponing her visit to St. Miidard's on his account, that 1 Both hymns are contained in the Jesuits' Hymn-book.\n",

There is an old-world ring about it, that carries one back to the days when railroads did not yet exist and daily posts were a thing of the future, when every laird was a little king, and the ' social mill' of London and continental life had not yet ground down the angles of individual character, and merged ' the picturesque of man and man' in mere outward polish. Maggie took her cousin up-stairs to her little room, and made sundry attempts to light a fire that would smoke. v She insisted on ]\\Iabers lying down on the bed meanwhile, and helped to unpack her things, talking rapidly all the time. ' Yes, dear, I'm glad that you made up your mind to come to us. It's lonely here at times now that Jamie has gone out into the world.

      "102 THE ATTEMPT With the awakening of nature, the animal creation also rejoices, as the reveille of summer is sounded by the voice of May. The cattle are turned out to pasture, the lambs frisk about in the sunshine, the hives send forth their earlier swarms of busy inhabitants, and the little glow-worm kindles her bright light to illumine the gloaming of the now-lengthening evenings. But, with a yet more gratulatory sj)irit, the feathered tribe keeps up a musical festival all day long, begun at \" heaven's gate, ere Phoebus 'gins arise,\" by the skylark—that favourite of Wordsworth, She Uey, and the Ettrick Shepherd,—and wound up with the delightful music of Milton's pet, the nightingale,— \" Sweet bird, that shunnest the noise of folly ! Most musical, most melancholy.\" In sympathy with this general rejoicing of nature, festivals have been instituted and kept on the first day of the return of May by all j^eople in all times, though differing according to the several lights of different periods of history. The origin of English May-festivals has been traced by some to the Floralia or Maiuma of the Eomans, and by others, to the sports of the Swedes and Goths ; but according to Mary Howitt, whose authority on such matters is by no means despicable, there is much more reason for deriving them from the Phallic Festivals of India and Egypt, which were introduced to this country by our ancient priests, the Druids. However derived. May-day was held as a festival as far back as the time of the Druids, by the burning of Belen's fire in honour of Bel, alias Apollo, alias Orus, and its observation continued through succeeding centuries ; Hone's every-day book, giving us an account (not less interesting from the quaint, old English in which it is written) how, when, \" in the nioneth of May, namely on May-day in the morning, every man, except impediment, would walk into the sweete meadows and greeue woods, King Henry the Eighth, with Queen Katherine his wife, and many lords and ladies, rode a-Maying from Greenwich to the high ground of Shooter's Hill,\" where they were unexpectedly entertained by the clever woodcraft of a band of archers, who must have been either a second edition of Eobin Hood and his merry men, or figurers in a certain May-day festival derived from the Moors, called the Morris dance, in which the actors blackened their faces to resemble Moors, and represented such personages as Kobin Hood, Maid Marian, Scarlet Stokesley. Little John, the Hobby Horse, Tom the Piper, and hosts of other characters, differing according to the time when they were played. From honest gatherers of olden chronicles, we learn that in London the May-pole used to bo brought into the town with great ceremony, and the festival kept ■ with all sorts of pastimes, even the milk-maids and chimney-sweeps joining in the_ rejoicing ;\n",

      "112 THE ATTEMPT in general considered him of such importance that no party was thought complete without his presence, and the journals of the day, in their accounts of such things, always placed the name of Beau Brummel first on the list. Of the manner in which he conducted himself in society many stories are told, illustrating that self-assurance which was such a prominent feature in his character. Dining one day where the champagne was not superb, he thus addressed the servant— \" John, give me a little more of that cider.\" On one occasion his club friends asked him why he had not dined with them the day before, to which he answered—\" A person of the name of li— asked me to notice him. Hence he prepared a dinner, to which I asked A—, N\"—, P—, and not a wish was ungratified, but R— had the assurance to sit with us !\" One time he asked to be allowed to drive home from some fete in a friend's carriage, and being told that he might, he said, \" Thank you exceedingly ; but how are you to go 1 surely you could not get up behind !\" Of course of the citj' or its denizens, Erummel pretended he knew nothing. One day a rich merchant there asked him to dine, which he promised to do, saying, \" If you wi U promise not to tell.\" One day a visitor bothered Brummel very much with numerous questions about a tour in the north of England which he had lately made ; when at last the inquirer came to ask which lake he preferred, he said, addressing his valet—\" Robinson, which lake did I prefer 1\" The prompt reply of the well-trained valet was, \" Windermere, Sir.\" \" Oh, yes, so it was; \" and so ended the questions. At an Ascot meeting when standing talking to a certain lady, she asked him if he was not afraid to be seen talking to so unfashionable a person. The beau replied—\" Pray, don't mention it; there is no one near us.\" Though not a susceptible man, there were two occasions, at least, on which Brummel did nearly \" his quietus make with a gold ring.\" On the latter of these affairs being broken off, a friend inquired the reason, when the beau said, \" I discovered that the Lady Mary actually ate cabbage ! \" As before mentioued, Brummel was once an intimate friend of the Prince of Wales, who was always happy to see him at Carlton House. The rupture, it is said, took place in consequence of Brummel, in fulfilment of a club bet, having said \" George, ring the bell,\" whereupon, it is added, his Royal Highness did as requested, and ordered Mr Brummel's carriage. After the quarrel, when riding in the park with a friend, Brummel met his Royal Highness with one of his friends. The Prince, to make the cut more apparent, stopped and spoke to his friend, but took no notice of Brummel. Never at a loss, the beau said quite aloud to his companion, as they passed on—\" Who is your sat friend ?\"\n",

      "126 THE ATTEMPT allowed to heal, but must be probed and laid open afresh. The torture can scarcely be mitigated by the knowledge that it is necessary. So to some sensitive minds the slightest hint of its mental wound is not less painful than the doctor's knife. And here, no feeling of necessity helps the sufferer to endure his martyrdom. It is on occasions like this that one feels inclined to cry, \" Save me from my friends,\" even though the allusions be softened and shrouded by texts, which one cannot but consider ill-timed, however well-meant and appropriate. As to the beginning of letters, pretty general rules have been laid down. The danger of seeming to mean too much or too little, is averted by the knowledge that you must address your dearest friend or greatest enemy in very nearly the same terms. But if the ways of beginning a letter are circumscribed, the endings are as varied as the writers. Some cry halt, abruptly, then dash into one of the common conclusions ; others gracefully train the last sentence, that it may not only express its own idea, but lead on to the next, which will tell you whether you are truly, or sincerely, or aifectionately regarded by the writer. In reading Lady Mary Wortley Montague's Letters, few of their admirable qualities strike the reader more than the various ways of concluding them. In these three volumes scarcely half-a-dozen of her letters end alike. In this they differ from the generality of letters, of whose concluding sentences it may be remarked, that scarcely half-a-dozen of them are different. Others again, oblivious of the fact, that two sheets, or even one, filled with common-place remarks is sufficient folly, wind up with a few polite falsehoods, in the way of imaginary messages of regard and affection. The knowledge that one is remembered by friends at a distance is no doubt a pleasant one, but the feeling of pleasure is certainly not enhanced by the suspicion that the messages have no surer foundation than the brain that imagined, and the paper that transmitted them. As some persons pay more attention to the adornment of the body than the mind, so some writers trouble themselves more about the material than the intellectual part of their correspondence. The monogram, like some secret sign, must be intelligible only to its owner and the initiated. The paper must be superfine, and is generally found more redolent of scent than of ideas. Of the envelope it may be said, that, like the waistcoat of the \" first gentleman in Europe,\" under that is to be found \" nothing.\" Indeed, the only thing to be approved of in such an epistle, is its brevity, which quality, if admirable in wit, is still more so in the absence of it. Some people seem to consider it the greatest compliment they can pay you, to return a fac-simile of your own letters. Like lawyers, who, on receiving a document, answer it by repeating the substance of itself, they keep your letter, and religiously answer each question, which\n",

Over-indulgence in youth causes many a heart-break in later years, and too many have been heard to say, \" Oh that my parents had ruled me better, and restrained me, then my evil passions would have been checked, and I should not have been a source of misery to myself and others.\" In the midst of an affectionate family Mrs Gaskell gently passed away, leaving us none but cheerful memories of her, and a legacy of the fruits of her graceful mind. We know as yet comparativelj-^ little of her life, but earnestly hope that the day is not very distant when a biography worthy of its subject may be presented to the public. A peculiarity of hers was that she required perfect quiet while engaged on any of her works, and generally retired to the country for this purpose. This was probably the result of the habits of her youth ; we are told that she passed many years of her life in a small country town, the original of \" Cranford;\" and a mind accustomed to the peace and quiet of such an existence Avould feel the want of it on these occasions. \"We may be grateful that the opportunity was afforded her, when we owe to it the pleasure and instruction derived from such books as \" Mary Barton,\" \" Cranford,\" \" Euth/' \" North and South,\" with others, and the excellent biography of \" Charlotte Bronte,\" already referred to. We have every reason to believe that the beautiful story of \" Wives and Daughters,\" edited in the \" Cornhill Magazine,\" is from her pen also. \" Mary Barton \" was her first novel : she was well acquainted with the phases of life as seen in a manufacturing town, and was able to depict them to the life. She always inspires us with sympathy with the characters, we tremble with them in their suspense, and rejoice in their joy. The one great event in this book is the trial for murder, its causes and effects, and although a temporary halo is thrown over mere commonplace people, we yet feel that they would probably have acted and spoken in this manner under the pressure of the peculiar circumstances. The exertions of Mary to obtain the acquittal of her lover, though great, and producing mental and bodily prostration afterwards, were only natural where remorse had set in so keenly, as in her case, and the mind almost unhinged by the violence of its emotions. Mrs Gaskell rightly supposes that a great mental strain may support the sufferer up to the moment when the danger ceases, and the faculties up to that time remain free for action; then, when the necessity for restraint is at an end the long pent \\\\p feelings give way, and a temporary (it may be final) clouding of the brain is the probable result, particularly in the young and those unaccustomed to endure trials. Another point that strikes us as evincing the authoress' knowledge of human nature is the coldness and \" touch me not\" manner of the hero Jem Burton's former employers and associates, when he is\n",

Every hero has his faults, and Dundee was certainly no exception to the rule; but let us beware, lest, in condemning him, we place ourselves in the category of those who, \"If they find Some spot or blemish in a name of note Not grieving that their greatest are so small— Inflate themselves with some insane delight, And judge all Nature from her feet of clay.\" Many people consider Visco Tmt Dundee as a blood-thirsty persecutor of the Church, the scourge of his country, and the enemy of all that was orderly, peaceable, or pious ; but, surely, we should pause to reflect ere we consign to such opprobrium the memory of one whose unflinching courage and stainless loyalty must bo admitted even by his bitterest foes, John Grahame of Claverhouse, Viscount Dundee, was the eldest son of Sir William and Lady Jean Grahame of Claverhouse. He was educated at the University of St Andrews, and subsequently enlisted as a volunteer in the French service, from which he passed into that of William of Orange. During his whole career abroad, he was distinguished for great intrepidity, and gained, as we are told by a historian of the period, \" the love and esteem of all his equals, as well as of those who had the advantage of liira in dignity and estate.\" He returned to Scotland in 1677, when he was appointed commander of an independent troop of horse, at the head of which he conducted a successful campaign against the Covenanters. In 1G82 he was appointed Sheriff of Wigtown, and for his services in that capacity, he was, two years later, sworn a privy councillor. In 1688, Claverhouse, who remained faithful to King James when the unhappy monarch's own children had forsaken him, was created Viscount Dundee and Lord Grahame of Claverhouse. In the May of 1689, he appeared in the Highlands at the head of an army of King James's adherents, and hastened to give battle to the Whigs, who were advancing, under General Mackay, through Athol.

Sins of the tongue are those into which we are peculiarly prone to fall, from such considerations as are mentioned above. How often, from a wish to prevent dissension or estrangement, to palliate the faults of our friends, or to bring about some object, in itself excellent and desirable, are we tempted to misrepresent, magnifiy, or diminish facts which seem too plain, too harsh, too disagreeable to be strictly attended to ! and how many, actuated by generous and unselfish motives, have slipped into the pit of falsehood, sinking deeper and deeper at every step, until extrication becomes almost impossible ! Scattered through the pages of history and fiction, we find many illustrious names stained with some crime, committed in the hope and belief that thereby \" good might come.\" One of the first that occurs to nie is that of Brutus, who, firmly impressed with the belief that the death of Caesar was necessary for the good of Eome, plunged his dagger into the breast of his friend and benefactor; and the name of Brutus, associated though it be with patriotism, courage, and magnanimity, has nevertheless come down to us as that of a traitor and an assassin from this cause alone,—he \" did evil that good might come.\" Turning to modern history, we find an example of the errors into which men may be betrayed from praiseworthy motives, in the conduct of Henry of Navarre.

For some days before the eventful one, the topic of weather was the one uppermost in our minds and conversation ; and the position in front of the barometer was generally to be found occupied by the tall Mr Jones, or the small Mr Brown. When the day arrived, the weather, as if in return for the attention it had received, was unexceptionable. Eleven o'clock saw the party muster, and after some polite discussion as to who should mount the box and who should go inside, and the judicious use of some diplomacy as to the distribution of the six Miss Smiths, the three waggonettes were filled—and started. Every one knows, or ought to know as soon as possible, the beautiful drive between Callauder and Loch Ard; how, leaving the village behind, we, by a wild moorland road, descend upon the romantic Lake of Menteith. Driving along the edge of the loch, we have a good view of the small island where Queen Mary, when a child, lived for some time with her four Marys. Many traditions are here connected with her, and the remains are still seen of what Dr John Brown calls the \" Child Queen's Child Garden.\" The boxwood surrounding it has grown to the height of fourteen feet during the three hundred years which have elapsed since the little queen, perhaps tended it with her own hands. Four miles further on we como to the picturesque \" Clachan of Aberfoil,\" the scene of Bailie Nicol Jarvie's exploits. We enlivened the way by singing glees, and the tall Mr Jones, who had brought his cornet with him, performed a solo, which was principally marked by an utter disregard of time, great physical exertion, and as having no apparent air whatever. Several of our party told amusing anecdotes, and a doctor who Avas with us was very loquacious, particularly on the subject of diphtheria. It was quite astonishing the hair-breadth escapes he related to us of some of his patients, who, but for his timely assistance, would have fallen victims to that fell disease. Indeed, when one young lady, as we were returning home, complained of fatigue, he advised her being laid along the floor of the carriage, \" as on a similar occasion had he not been present and taken precautionary measures, the excessive over-exertion might have induced the disease, and, in fact, but for these precautionary measures, he would not have been answerable for the consequences.\" Now and then we passed families of gipsies, and the children generally convoyed us some distance in the hope of money being thrown to them. They, doubtless, found the exertion well repaid, as an English clergyman, who was with us, produced a seemingly unlimited supply of threepennies and fourpennies with which he was provided.\n",

Three months and four passed, but still I looked in vain, when one morning 1 received a letter from Australia. It was from a friend who had been very kind to us, and she wrote saying that doubtless long ere I received her letter my daughter would be safe with me at home, as she had sailed in the 'Mary Anne,' a month before she wrote. Strange to say I felt no alarm, but thinking I must soon see the arrival of the ' Mary Anne' announced, I went to Mr Melville to shew my letter. When I entered, I saw Mr Melville hastily sold and pocket the newspaper, while they both had a startled look. This I remembered afterwards, but scarcely noticed at the time. \" ' They will soon be home now, they sailed in the \" Mary Anne \" before this letter was written,' I exclaimed, holding it up, and then after reading it to them, I asked when they thought I should start for Liverpool, as I must be there, I said when the ship came in. \" ' We shall see, we shall see,' said Mr Melville, trying to smile, but something in his manner made a chill creep over me, and my sense of hearing was quickened I suppose by fear, for I heard distinctly Mr Melville whisper to his wife, ' Yes, Mary, it is the same, you must tell her, God comfort her.' \" ' What is it she must tell me, what has happened, have you heard any bad news 1' I asked fiercely. \" Mrs Melville took my hand and burst into tears; ' My dear Anne,' she said, 'I only wished to remind you that it might be God's will that the \" Mary Anne \" should never arrive.' \" ' Mary,' I said, speaking with a frightfully calm voice, I seemed turned to stone, ' you have not told me all—you have seen something in the the paper Mr Melville put in his pocket as I came in ;' and turning to him I demanded the paper from him. \" ' Mary will tell you all,' he said, ' and I trust it may prove an unfounded alarm.' \" Mrs Melville then told me that great anxiety had been felt on account of the non-appearance of the ' Mary Anno,' and now they feared the worst, as there was a rei)ort that a bottle had been picked up on the coast of Portugal with a letter inside directed to the Captain's mother.

' Say,' he said, ' that our ship seems a little heaven, all, both crew and passengers, in the midst of the fury of the elements, are so filled with the peace of God, that should the fiery chariots of Elijah appear, I think I would not wonder much.' \" That letter was the only thing ever seen of the ' Mary Anne.' She had sunk in mid ocean, and all on board were drowned. Long, long I rebelled against the chastening hand of the Almighty, but at length I was enabled to say, ' Thy will be done.' I continued to live in the house I had taken on the Abbey Hill, till Mr and Mrs Melville proposed coming here, when, seeing my grief at the thought of losing their society, they most kindly asked me to make my home with them, which osier I was only too glad to accept.

There were at that time so many storms at sea that many vessels lay in near the coast for shelter.

Beneath your feet, as you gaze, runs an underground communication between Castle and Palace, now unused. It is said that in the last century a bold piper tried to pass that way, and played his pipes loudly until he came as far as the Cross, when they were silenced, and what became of him then and there is left for you, bold antiquarian, to discover. Almost every grim high-storeyed house that frowns above you has been the platform of scenes as wild as Holyrood itself, whose true romances no one ever can forget. Here once lived a man called John Knox,—yonder, in a small summerhouse in the Moray House Gardens, the Articles of the Union were signed, in the same domain that once echoed to the tramp of Cromwell's men, or the trip of the Regent Moray's fair sister Mary. The College now stands on the site of the once lonely Kirk-o'-field ; the bones of the Scottish Martyrs lie in Greyfriars Churchyard ; and Captain Porteous sadly remembered the West Port, through which passed so proudly the bold Claverhouse.

He wrote in every variety of style—epic, dramatic, lyric, operatic, besides several prose works; but his lyric poems are those which won for him same, great even during his life, and undiminished by the hand of time. May I be allowed one more quotation from Beolchi 1 I must premise that I cannot pretend to judge of its truth, but shall subjoin a translation for the benefit of Greek scholars who may not understand Italian. \" Su Chiabrera il primo che sul Pamaso Italiano accoppiasse il fuoco di Pindaro alle grazie d'Anacreonte.\" (Chiabrera was the first who, on the Italian Parnassus, joined the fire of Pindar to the grace of Anacreon.) Vigour and harmony are indeed united in Chiabrera's verses to a veiy high and unusual degree. His erotic poetry, in particular, is remarkable for the skilful blending of the strong with the sweet, and is characterized throughout by glowing imagination and sparkling fancies. I do not think there is in all Italian lyric poetry anything more elegant and playful than Chiabrera's Canzonetta, \" Belle rose porporine.\" But his poetry is far surpassed in grandeur of conception and severe simplicity of style by Vincenzioda Filicaja, a Florentine senator, who flourished in the latter half of the seventeenth century. A majestic melancholy, a calm and dignified serenity, are the most prominent characteristics of his poetry, although, in his patriotic poems, the fiery Italian spirit is constantly breaking forth in fierce, impetuous, passionate strophes and stanzas which reveal the genius of Filicaja in a more striking light than even his exquisite sonnets. His love-poems are very few in number; and in some of the sonnets addressed to private individuals, he somewhat neglects the elegant simplicity so noticeable in most of his works, and his style becomes \" un po' troppo froudoso.\" It is upon his religious and patriotic poems that his same most surely rests—and the name of Filicaja must be dear to the heart of every Italian for whom religion and patriotism are anything more than mere names. His numerous sonnets upon the death and passion of Our Lord, with those addressed to the Crucifix, and the Vii'gin Mary, are written in a spirit of reverent adoration, of j^rofound humility, which lends a deeper interest and attraction to the beauty and power of the sonnets themselves. The sonnets to Fortune, to Providence and to Death, are especially deserving of remark, and although it is evident from all Filicaja's works that \" melancholy marked him for her own,\" yet we nowhere find the slightest approach to misanthropy or murmuring. But the most famous of all his sonnets is the sublime one, \" All' Italia\"— \" Italia, Italia, otu, cui feo la sorte Dono infelice di belezza \"\n",

It catches eagerly at accidents and accessories, as if its existence depended on knowing the sort of coat a great man preferred to wear, or the several items of a long past treaty, made, like pie-crust, to be broken. Profound knowledge, on the contrary, goes straight towards the core of its subject, and prizes its details, not for themselves, but as precious clues by which to gain access to its inner meaning. Thus, shallow people are apt to attribute tbe Reformation in England to the matrimonial scandals of bluff King Harry, and fancy that the essence of Scottish history in the sixteenth century lies in the beauty and misfortune of Mary, Queen of Scots. They read the story of the French Revolution as a mere chapter of mishaps and misunderstandings. They find many causes for the terrible catastrophe— the king's indecision ; the queen's want of etiquette ; the false gossip circulated concerning her and the far-famed diamond necklace ; the intrigues of Philip Egalite ;— but they do not see tbat these were only fissures in the rock throiigli which the long pent-up lava found vent at last.

Dragons of the prime, That tare each other m their slime, Were mellow music matched with him.\" It is not so. There is a hand that wields the force which quickens nature's pulses, that nurses the rose-bud into bloom, while it guides the stars in their courses, and rules in the wildest pages of man's history. We confess this truth, we feel it vividly at times, yet too often we leave it out of mind in our intellectual pursuits. It is little wonder if, at such times, the mere outside shell of knowledge should be all we gain. M. L.\n",

The rest were down stairs in the dining-room, where there was still a fire, but she had taken her work, and was sitting near the window, with the bright sun shedding a golden light all over her, when he passed through the garden, and, looking up, smiled and bowed. The minutes seemed hours as she sat waiting,—he could not go without saying good-by, without one word to ask her not to forget him. There was a step on the stair, and then her sister's voice called \" Come down stairs, Minnie, Frank Warden has come to say good-by.\" She rose, folded her work, and went down. He was standing, as was his custom, leaning on the mantelpiece, and looked round as she came in, with some laughing remark about her incessant industry. \" I'll be an old married man M^hen you come back, Frank,\" said young Newton, gaily. \" Oh, no,\" said Mary, \" he must not be so long as that, or I'll be too old to wear the splendid diamond earrings he is to bring me.\" \" And he'll tell us lots of stories about the wild beasts,\" said George, who had just come in from school, and flung his books on the table. \" Oh, yes, plenty of traveller's tales,\" answered Frank; \" but it is time I were off.\" Minnie rose, and stood by the mantelpiece. It was dreadful to say good-by thus, with them all standing round, and more dreadful still without one word of regret. Those lines often recui Ted to her afterwards, when she looked back on that moment— \" 'Wami Zwei von einander schei Jen So geben sie sich die Hiind ' Und fangen an zu weiuen Und seufzen ohne End.' Wir haben nicht geweinet Wii' seufzen nicht Web ! und Ach ! Die Tbriinen und dio soufzer Die kamen hintennach.\" His hand trembled slightly as he took hers, but he looked past her at the clock on the mantelpiece, saying, \" I fear I am late,\" and then he was gone; and she went up-stairs again with a feeling that something was dead in her life. Only once during the long years that followed did he mention Minnie Stanley in his letters. One day she had gone down to see old Mrs Coutts, Frank's aunt. \" When arc you to be married, Minnie ?\" she asked.\n",

Roscoe, from her poem on \" Charity.\" In it she has fathomed the true depth of that divine virtue, the virtue which \" hopeth all things.\" She shows us the presumption of judging any man by outward signs— \"There may be hope, as pure, as bright, As ever sought eternity ; There may be hght, clear heavenly light. Where a U seems cold and dai-k to thee ; And where thy vision mourns the dust, There may be trust, delightful trust.\" Tliere are some writei's who have given to the world one or two flashes of genius so bright, that eveiy one has recognised them withovit knowing anything further of their woiks. Miss Catherine Fanshawe is one of these ; though admu'ed for her many accomplishments, and venerated for her \" simple piety,\" by the cii'cle in which she moved, it is only through a few of her most brilliant poems that she is universally known. We need only remind our readers of her \" Epistle to Earl Harcourt,\" in which she so successfully vindicates herself for spelling her name of Catherine with a C instead of a K, as that gentleman was desirous she should do. The lively humour running through the whole of this clever poem makes it very attractive. Many people ascribe to Lord Byron one of Miss Fanshawe's best riddles, indeed, it is still to be found in some of the editions of his works. It is that most ingenious of riddles clothed in verse, commencing— \" 'Twaa in Heaven pronounced, 'twas muttered in Hell, And echo caught faintly the sound as it fell.\" Wo pass on now to what seems to us one of the most beautiful sonnets to be met with in the volume before us ; the author is Hartley Coleridge, son of The Coleridge.

The representatives of the second or Thistle tribe are numerous. One of the most elegant and beautiful of the family is the Centaurea Ci/anus, or Blue-bottle, with bright bine flowers, the outer florits being much larger than the inner, the calyx scaly, the stem slender, and the leaves narrow and woolly. Very common, likewise, are the Knap-weeds, Centaurea Nigra and Centaurea Scahiosa, the latter bearing handsome crimson-coloured flowers. During the present and succeeding month, the many species of Thistles are in perfection ; the white, downy plants of the Cotton Thistle {Onopordum Acanthium); the Prickly Scotch Thistle {Cnicus Lanceolatus) ; the almost crimson flowers of Cnicus Acau Us, Plume Thistle ; the large, solitary, drooping flowers, of a purple colour and peculiar scent, of the Musk Thistle (Garduus Nutans) ; the smaller, more numeous heads of the Prickly Thistle {Carduus Acanthoides), and the broad, variegated leaves of the Milk or Holy Thistle {Carduus Marianus), supposed to have been dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The varietj^ which is generally regarded as the memorial plant of Scotland is the Lanceolatus, but some claim that distinction for the Melancholy Thistle. In case there should be any of my readers hitherto equally ignorant with myself as to the time when the Thistle was first adopted as oar national emblem, I shall transcribe the following extract from an old magazine whicli lately fell into my hands :—\" Time was when a company of bearded men, with high-crowned hats and doublets, met in solemn consultation within the walls of the old Council House of Edinburgh, the subject of their deliberation being the desirableness of placing the Thistle on their banner, instead of the figure of St Giles, which had borne many a highland storm. This Council was convened about the middle of the fifteenth century, and shortly afterwards the Melancholy Thistle, whicli had hitherto been deemed the badge of the house of Stuart, became conspicuous on every banner throughout Scotland.\" Another plant, not unlike tlie thistle, now to be met with in waste places, is the Teazel, deriving its scientific name of Dipsacus from the Greek word signifying thirst}^, the leaves being so i:ieculiarly constructed that they embrace the stalk and form a sort of cup-like cavity capable of retaining moisture.

These various misfortunes so disturbed my mind, that I had quite forgotten the mysterious sounds which had been the beginning of the day's discomforts, and I made a rush at the dining-room door, thinking that there I would be safe from further traps and obstructions, but just inside the doorway I came violently in contact with a sweep, who had returned for some implements he had left behind. The shock was great—both started back—he grinned and apologised—I retired precipitately, covered with confusion and soot. As the dining-room was the scene of cleaning operations at this juncture, breakfast was laid in the schoolroom. Breakfast in the schoolroom ! I knew from sad experience what that implied, and experience did not deceive me. The table, brought from some other part of the house, was far too large for the room ; consequently the hind legs of my chair were inside the sender, and my sister, who sat opposite me, was wedged tightly in between the table and the piano. Two of the children breakfasted at a side table, and made a point of spilling at least half of every cupfull or platefu U which they carried from our table to theirs ; and I am sure the sweeps must have had some hand in the preparation of our morning meal, for everything on the table was more or less impregnated with soot. But the worst feature of breakfast in the schoolroom only began to manifest itself after breakfast was over; I allude to the unaccountable disappearance of half of the children's school-books, and the dire confusion which prevailed among the other half Harry's Euclid, after a vigorous search, was discovered in Mary's workbasket, where her work was not; his Latin exercise had been taken to light the fire ; and his Yirgil was gone utterly and totally, without a clue as to its whereabouts ; Mary was still worse ofl\", for her grammar, history, sjjelling-book, and atlas had been removed at one fell swoop by the demon of house cleaning; her work-basket was minus thimble and scissors, and Harry had spilt his tea over her music portfolio.

Some consideration will enable the reader to recognize our young sailor friend who announced to the group of talkers at the village inn, his intention of visiting his aunt. Some time later he arrived in a half-drowned plight at his aunt's abode —this relative being none other than Mrs Dumpling. That worthy lady, soiled in her attempts to coddle her master, was descending the kitchen stairs in no good frame of mind, when she heard a loud, hearty voice in friendly conversationf with Betsy Jane. With matronly and zealous vigilance Mrs Dumpling stole along the passage, confident of entrapping Betsy Jane wasting her time with the baker, the postman, or some one or other of those daily visitors, whose lingering attentions to Betsy Jane it was one of the greatest of Mrs Dumpling's pleasures to cut short. She entered the kitchen, and had just begun—\" Well! I do say Bet—\" when a huge, damp figure rushed at her from behind the door, and, embracing her fondly, danced up and down the kitchen in a kind of barbaric waltz, till Betsy Jane leant against the wall, and gave herself up to hopeless shrieks of laughter, which were echoed by screams of real alarm from Mrs Dumpling. But to waltz with Mrs Dumpling was no joke, and the sailor soon stopped from sheer fatigue. Mrs Dumpling, now released, turned savagely to Betsy Jane, when her nephew rushed up again— this time taking the precaution to say— \" Why, auntie, don't you know me 1 \" \" Jim, my dear, dear boy,\" cried Mrs Dumpling, laughing and crying both at once. \" To be sure I do—my dear Mary's child, of course I know you.\" And Mrs Dumpling and her nephew met in a hearty embrace, while Betsy Jane went out of the room on pretence of getting a clean table-cloth. A quarter of an hour saw Jim seated at the hospitable table of his aunt, ministered to by Betsy Jane. Mrs Dumpling, much against his will, had succeeded in wrapping him up in her dressing-gown; and his own jacket now hung on a chair before the fire, sending up a wreath of steam to the very ceiling. They were a very happy party. Jim drank ten cups of tea, and Betsy Jane had to make three more platefuls of buttered toast.

Towards the end of the evening, I had gone out on the balcony with Dr Irwin, to show him the \" lie \" of a stream which he and Davie intended to fish next day; but the moonlight fell unfavourably, and the part of the landscape we wished to see was shrouded in darkness. Harry Wyvill came out to us, the bearer of Mrs Wyvill's entreaties that I would \"come in from the night air;\" so we turned to re-enter the drawing-room. But just opposite the window, at the far end of the drawing-room, was a \" tableau vivant\" so beautifully grouped, that we all three paused to look at it before we entered. Miss Tyrell was kneeling on a low ottoman, looking up with a smile at my sister Minnie, who was adjusting some flowers that had slipped from their proper position in Miss Tyrrel's hair; and the two figures, for grouping and colouring, would have delighted the eye of an artist; but alas ! alas ! my eye was that of a sister— and the picture was spoiled for me. Caroline Tyrrel, with her majestic figure, her grand, calm face, her lustrous eyes, and (pardon the feminine observation !) her magnificent dress, looked, in spite of her kneeling posture, \" every inch a queen;\" while my little Minnie, small and slight as a fairy, with laughing blue eyes, a flexible, ever-changing face, a plain white dress, and a blue ribbon snooded among her brown curls, looked like the handmaid to the princess, honoured by rendering her a service—happy in wreathing flowers in Miss Tyrrel's hair ! I looked up at Mr Wyvill, and by the expression of mingled wonder, curiosity, and disappointment on his face, I saw that his thoughts were something like mine, and, mortified beyond expression, I dashed into the room, caught hold of Jack, and begged him to come home—thus breaking up the tableau, and partially relieving my feelings. Harry walked home with us, and everything seemed just as usual; but T could not forget that look,—and when I fell asleep, T dreamt that Miss Tyrrel was Bloody Mary, and had ordered Minnie to be executed for plaiting her hair too tight.

The plot is brilliantly worked out; the characters as life-like as in any of his former novels ; and the supernatural element in which he delights most delicately introduced. But, instead of discussing the Waverley Novels, let us call to mind the days when they first opened their treasures to us,—when Jeanie Deans and Flora Mac Ivor became our intimate friends; when we escaped with Queen Mary from Lochleven Castle, or passed long summer afternoons in the Antiquary's study. Delightful days ! when there was no reluctance to avow ourselves Jacobites, nor shame in adopting Queen Mary's cause ; when conscientious scruples did not prevent us from laughing at old Mause and Gabriel Kettledrummle, even while we sympathised With Henry Morton and detested Claverhouse. Those days of enchantment soon pass, and are genei-ally followed by a time when the new class of literature is much more inviting, until it has done its work, and people return to their first and last favourites, the novels of Sir Walter Scott. The attempt which is being made to revive Richardson's novels, though they may be welcomed as improvements upon some of the books in favour now, shows in what direction we are going. Sooner or later the re-action must come, though it may not begin until we are plunged into the abyss from which Scott rescued a former generation, and need the aid of another genius, who, by introducing purer and more healthy tastes, will sweep clean the shelves of libraries and bookstalls, to make room for fictions of a nobler stamp. The misfortune has been, that those writers of the present scliool wlio handled great social questions in books, whose influence for good cannot be calculated, were followed by a host of imitators, touching on the same topics, without the same genius, and writing merely for temporary same. As might have been expected, they brought discredit, in many circles, upon the books they endeavoured to copy, and destroyed much of the good which would naturally have resulted from them. Like most true geniuses. Sir Walter Scott felt deeply his responsibility before God for the use of his talents. It is refreshing to turn away from the idle fiction-mongers, who are so plentiful now, and read the dying words of the great author, as Lockhart reports them :---\" I am drawing near to the close of my career. I am fast shufiling ofi\" the stage. I have been, perhaps, the most voluminous author of the day, and it is a comfort to me that I liave tried to unsettle no man's faith, to corrupt no man's principle, that I have written nothing which on my deathbed I could wish blotted out.\" R.

      "136 THE ATTEMPT. Were ever knights so widely famed as they ? did any ever do like mighty deeds t We have already noticed the force of the bond between one knight and that other who had dubbed him so, old or young, king or baron. To him he yielded every honour,—against him he never would lay lance in rest, though his inaction should be at the risk of his own life. But the affection that most powerfully swayed the knight, was the peculiar character of his devotion to womanhood. In his mind, woman was a being with a mystic power, and of a nature differing from his own,—more akin to, and conversant with, the spiritual world beyond. This idea was increased by the idolatrous love and worship paid to the Virgin Mary, and through her to her sex. So when a knight learned to love, he also reverenced the object of his affection. Fickleness in him was a sin classed with impiety; disrespect a fault unprovided for. His lady was no toy to be played with, but a divinity to be worshipped, and to be worshipped through life and death. Loyalty was the choicest, the most essential quality in the \" preux chevalier.\" No penalty was annexed to disobedience, as such a thing was deemed impossible, seeing that a knight was permitted to break the rules of his order even, at his lady's command. But she was too careful of his honour, ever to ask him to do anything that would be reprobated by the society they moved in. The high idea formed thus of her character and power, raised her almost to its level, as far as was possible to mortal. Even until this day, we find men to be greatly what we expect them to be. Great expectations plant the seeds of great results, and so it was then. In that more singleminded, even-paced age-—the knight who expected his lady to be a goddess, found her nearly so. His reverence naturally led him into some absurdities. Each knight maintained, at the point of the lance, that his chosen love was the fairest lady known. To us it seems that it would have been much wiser to have insisted that she was the fairest for him; and then all might have been satisfied at once. But then many a pleasant cause of displaying his bravery would have been lost; and he knew how much his bravery did him service in winning his lady's affections. Indeed, in those days, it was the one thing needful; it could atone for the want of every personal grace. A damsel, who was once reproached with having loved an uncommonly ugly man, replied—\" He is so valiant, I have never looked in his face !\" Indeed, if bravery had no effect, the knight was at a loss how to proceed further. Wo, in these modern days, might think other things as impoitant as bravery ; and that, of itself, certainly not all-sufficient. But in those unsettled and lawless times, nothing could give a woman a greater sense of security and tinist than a tried and brave lover or husband, who was not only willing, but able, to defy the Avorld\n",

The embankments of my will are waxed weak through age, and they are giving way at last. The glass tells me my forehead is shaded now with silvered hair, not thin and spare, but rich and gleaming. Though I feel I am going fast down the hill of life, I am yet hale and strong ; I have many friends, and many a home circle opens to receive me. I cannot call myself an unhappy man; and yet to-day I can almost say it truly. Ah ! how those \"memories of long-ago\" rise around me ! and many a lovely scene of gladness, many a happy day of youth, comes thronging in strange distinctness to my brain ; and as the memory of each touches some long silent heart-string, and thrills it with forgotten emotions, I find it is a memory of pain that awakens the loudest chord. Yes, all these past joys converged in intensity to one sacred point of bliss, and that is now the centre of deepest pain.

And as I linger over the \" soft dissyllable,\" I ponder the sweetness of that name, whose essence is bitterness. Sacred history first, and the world's history ever since, alike have their records of sorrow linked with the name of Mary. I am but one mourner more to swell the silent train of the past; and now, as I murmur that gentlest sound, scarce can I keep a tear from welling up to betray me to myself. What! shall T weep a wily enchantress, a faithless heart-breaker ? Ah, never again may such words break from my lips ! I have learnt in long years to forgive, and to rejoice in her welfare : and shall a life-long lesson be forgotten now 1 I dare not linger over this heart's history, lest I forget I am a man, and weep, or give way to fiery thoughts of indignation. Farewell, then, to this brief hour of recollection; I must close for ever this heart-cemetery.

It is surrounded by an oval wall, forty feet high, to keep out the plundering Arabs; and pilgrims are admitted by being drawn up in a basket by a rope and pulley. The knights took the rule of St Basil, and wore a black garment, with a blue cross edged with gold, in the form of the letter T. They were allowed to marry, but were kept under great restrictions. They vowed to defend the Christian religion and the empire, and to go to war whenever or wherever commanded. 1063.—The Order of St Katharine, at Mount Sinai, was instituted to defend the Sepulchre of St Katharine, who suffered martyrdom in Alexandria, under the Emperor Maximius, and to protect and entertain pilgrims. They wore a white garment, and a Katharine wheel interlaced with the cross of Jerusalem. The Order of St Blaize, called also the Knights of St Mary in Palestine, wore a sky-coloured garment, and a gold cross, bearing the figure of St Blaize. Tits Order of Knights of the Martyrs in Palestine took their name from the hospital dedicated to St Cosmos and St Damianus—Martyrs, and wore as their badge a red cross, in the middle of wliich the two saints were encircled with a glory. They were bound to exercise all charity to the sick and poor, to redeem captives, and bury the dead. When they removed to Europe they conformed to the rule of St Augustine. The Order of Mount-Joy, called so from the name of the castle built upon the eminence near Jerusalem, whence the pilgrims first perceived the Holy City. Their habit was a short red mantle, on the breast of which they wore a white star with five rays. They protected the path of the pilgrims; and, after the loss of the Holy Land, they retired into Spain, and were incorporated into the order of Calatrava. 1099.—Tli^ Order of the Knights Hospitallers of St John and of Malta owed theii' beginning, or rather restoration, to Gerard of Provence ; though some of their legends refer their original to Johannes Hircanus, or John Patriarch of Jerusalem. It is, at least, known that a monk named Bernhard, in 870, had liuilt an hospital in the valley of Malta, near the church of St Mary, and that certain Christian merchants of Malfi, in the kingdom of Naples, trading to Palestine, obtained leave from the Caliph to support it, and to build another house for women. Finding their accommodation still too limited, they built a large hospital, which they dedicated to St John, near the Holy Sepulchre. So many volunteered their services, that the attendants were formed into a band, and finally an order of knighthood. Gerard of Provence disciplined them and framed their rules ; but it was not until the third Superior after his death, that it became a part of their duty to sight the infidel as well as to\n",

When Godfrey, the leader of the first Crusade, saw how much good they did, he presented them with the rich lordship of Mountboie in France; Baldwin gave them part of all the booty he took; and many others followed their example, till the once \" poor knights of St John\" became noted for wealth. They had above 20,000 manors throughout Europe. When they were driven out of Palestine they removed to Cyprus, and thence to the island of Rhodes, where they were attacked, and, in spite of a brave resistence, expelled by Solyman the Magnificent. Malta, Tripoli, and Gaza were granted them in see by the Emperor Charles V. in 1530, upon the tenure of one falcon yearly to the Viceroy of Sicily, and the acknowledgement of the King of Spain and Sicily as their protector. They settled in Malta, where, in 1563, they were besieged by Solyman, but the Turks were compelled to retire with great loss. The number of knights was one thousand, of whom five hundred were to reside in Malta, and the remainder, dispersed in seminaries throughout the Continent, were to be ready to collect at any summons from their Grand Master. They must prove their gentility for six descents, and swear to defend the Church, to obey their superiors, follow their rules exactly, and live only on the revenue of their order. Their smallest errors were punished with most severe penances, in their earlier times at least. Each knight was bound to keep a light burning near him while he slept, that the wicked enemy and all evil spirits might be scared off. They wore the black habit of St Augustine, except in war, when they wore a crimson robe, and on their breasts a white cross. There were several branches of this order. 1107.—The Order of Ladies Knights of Malta was instituted by Agnes, Abbess of the Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, who, with her companions, made the same profession, took the same habits, and vowed to obey the same rules as Gerard de Didier had appointed in 1099 for the Knights of St John. The Order of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem was, according to Savin, instituted by Baldwin I. They resided near the Holy Sepulchre, and were bound to guard it, and, at the same time, to relieve and protect pilgrims. The Patriarch of Jerusalem was their Grand Master. Their habit was white, and on their breast a gold cross-potent. When the city was taken by the Saracens, they retired to Perugia in Italy, and were afterwards united to the Knights of St John. 1119.^—In this year Hugh de Paganes and Godfrey de St Amor, with seven other gentlemen, went to the Holy Land, and devoted themselves to the duty of dispei'sing the robbers that infested the path of the pilgrims to Jerusalem.

In 1572, Pope Gregory XII. united those of the order in Italy with the Order of St Maurice, then newly instituted by the Duke of Savoy j and, in 1608, this order was united in France to that of the above-mentioned Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The knights of St Lazarus and Mount Carmel are allowed to many, even twice, and to hold ecclesiastical sinecure benefices, or pensions charged upon ecclesiastical livings. It may be suitable to class among religious orders those instituted in the Pope's dominions; as the military was then necessarily subordinate. 1198.—The Order of the Holy Ghost at Rome, instituted by Innocent III., lived under the rule of St Augustine, and did many great deeds of charity with their ample income of 24,000 ducats a day. A certificate of gentility required. 1233.—The Order of the Virgin Mary was instituted by Bartholomew, Bishop of Vicenza. They followed the rule of St Dominic, wearing a white surcoat, over which was a cloak of gray, and on theii' breast a cross pattee red, sui Taounted with two stars. Their profession was to protect widows and orphans; to endeavour to reconcile domestic difi^erences between husband and wife ; and to promote everywhere reconciliation and peace. They had no monastery, and were allowed each to dwell in his own house and with his own family. 1320.—The Order of Jesus Christ instituted by Paul XXII. while residing at Avignon. 1498.—The Order of St George at Rome, instituted by Alexander VI. in order to encourage naval enterprises against the pirates. 1520.—The Order of St Peter ami St Raul, instituted by Leo X. to defend the sea-coasts of his territories against the Turks. There were four hundred of them chosen, who were distinguished by wearing a medal with an image of the saints, one on either side. 1534.—The Order of St George at Ravenna, instituted to defend that town and the marches of Ancona against the Corsairs. 15GO.—The Order of Rius, instituted by Pope Pius IV. 1587.—The Order of Loretto, instituted by Sextus Quintus, on his creating a new sea at Loretto, and appointing the celebrated church there a cathedral. The knights were numerous, and were distinguished by wearing an image of the Virgin Mary hanging to a gold chain at the button-hole,—hence called Chevaliers Dores. 1615.—The Order of Jesus and Mary, instituted by Paul V. to jiiotect the Holy See against infidels and heretics.

At his death, his mantle, with the book of statutes, is sent to Windsor. For the convenience of travelling now, the knights of the order are permitted to wear a blue ribbon under their boot instead of the garter, but without that, and their lesser George and Star, by the statutes of the order, they are never permitted to appear in public, except iipon the principal feasts of the year, when they wear their collar, and the ribbon and George become unnecessary. The first ofiice is the Prelate—the Bishop of Winchester for the time being ; next the Cliancellor—the Bishop of Salisbury for the time being. Both of these receive the highest honours in the land. They wear purple velvet robes. The Register of the order wears a crimson satin robe, and on his breast a red book of the order, with the device of two pens saltere within the garter. The fourth officer is Garter, appointed by Henry V., who is the princij^al officer within the College of Arms, and chief of the heralds. His robe is the same as the Register's. The fifth and last officer is the Black Rod. He also must be a gentleman of blood and ai'ms, born within the sovereign's dominions, and if not a knight at his election, he must be knighted, and appointed Chief Usher in the kingdom, for the honour of the order.

Queen Anne elected thirteen, amongst whom was George Augustus Elector of Hanover, afterwards King of England. Twenty-one knights were made by George I., thirty three by George II. This list goes no farther. The sees due to the king's servants, from all who receive the honour of knighthood, amount to X76, 15s. 4d. ; but there is a scale of installation sees, according to rank, for those who receive the order of the garter.

The Register receives 13s. 4d. for installation see, and from £40 to £28 for the Robe; while Garter receives for installation from £40 to £10, and likewise for the Robe from £60 to £30. The Black Rod receives from £40 to £10; and various sums are distributed to the king's servants, amounting in all to £103, 16s. for a king, down to £26, 11s. 8d. for a Knight Bachelor; so that there is no slight expense incurred in receiving this highest honour in our land.

The Seal was engraved on one side, with the king's effigy on horseback in armour, the shield azure, three impeiial crowns or, the arms usually ascribed to King Arthur, with the superscription—\" Sigilluno Honoratissime Orduris Militares de Balereo.\" The knights of the order wear a surcoat of red tatfata. lined with white, and girt about with a white girdle, and a mantle the same as the surcoat.

      "98 THE ATTEMPT. There were steps behind us, and up came young Glynne, and a yoimg man, whom I supposed to be a friend of his. The moonlight was now clear and brilliant, though the raging wind was as strong as ever, and I noticed his face,—a handsome one certainly, but even in that moment of first sight I did not like it. Very dark, but with light blue eyes set near together, and having from that fact a peculiar brilliancy. The contrast between these very light and very bright eyes and his dark complexion and black curly hair, struck me at once; also the contrast between his careless clegage air of aristocracy, and the extremely commonplace and somewhat plebeian appearance of his companion, Henry Glynne. The latter is easily described. He was short, broad-chested, thick-necked, narrow of forehead and chin, but wide of mouth,—even the moustache could not conceal the thick lips and heavy outline, carefully as it \\^as cultivated. He was neat, but rather \"loud\" in his style of dress, and the greatest attraction, in a pecuniary point of view, in St Michael's, being possessed, report said, of £8000 per annum, made by his father in the sugar trade. His mother and two sisters lived with him at St Michael's, and, as I have said, he was a decided admirer of Una's. Unsuited as that moment was to such reflections, I could not help thinking he had not helped his cause by appearing beside this very handsome stranger, who must have been over six feet high, and had a remarkably good figure. But Una only saw in them possible leaders of the forlorn hope she was so anxious to organise. \" Oh, Mr Glynne,\" she cried, entirely forgetting the strangeness of the meeting and the whole affair, \" do help mc to persuade the men to take a boat across to that ship. Look, every wave washes over it; they will all be lost before anything is done.\" She had anticipated Mr Glynne's exclamation of surprise, and he replied—\" I heard a ship was on the rocks, and Maiyon and I thought we might be of use. (My friend, Captain Maryon, Miss Ferguson, Miss Una Ferguson)—but after all, what can be done, eh, Maryon 1\" \" Well,\" answered a voice with a little of a foreign ring in it, \" if there is anything to be done, I'm your man. What ladies suggest should never be impossible. I say, my men, which of you will go with me to that inviting looking rock over there ]\" He put his hand into his pockety but there was a protest from the men. \" Nay, sir, if it ain't worth our while already, money won't make it so. If so be as your honour is willing to risk your life, why shouldn't we be ?' The leader had been all that was wanting, the \" with me \" had its certain efiect j the men were ready and willing.\n",

There is no man a woman admires so quickly as \"he that does the thing she dares not do.\" \"No time to lose,\" said Cajjtain Maryon, as he saw how fast the ship was breaking up. \" No, Glynne, you stay and keep these ladies from fainting, I won't let you come ; think of your mother and sisters. If I'm swamped, there'll be one vagabond the less in the world, and my affectionate friends will be spared the expense of a tombstone. Unless they are all mistaken in their conjectures besides, there's hemp in my weird that ensures me against salt water. Will you let me shake hands with you ? \" he said, coming up to us, \" we have met so strangely, and we may never meet again.\" We gave him our hands, and he must have pressed Una's very hard, for she blushed and half turned away. \" Good-bye, and God bless you for your brave heart,\" I said half involuntarily. Then a cry of \" all ready, sir,\" rose from the men, and the stranger jumped into the boat just as she put off—off into that awful sea ! I could not help shuddering, as I saw how she seemed buried every few minutes by some tremendous surge, and then rose over it like a sea-gull. No thought of going home before her return came into either of our minds; but we watched with straining eyes and inward prayers that black speck on the angry sea. How many would be saved, even if they reached the ship in time; and if not, what succour could there be 1 Nearer and nearer, slowly breasting the billows, preserved as if by a miz'acle, the deliverers came, then suddenly a mighty wave swept with a deadly force over the wreck, and hurled her off the rock into the boiling sea. Such a cry as went up from those perishing sailors I never heard before, and God grant 1 never may again. The boat was near enough to save some ; too late, alas, for many, for the ship went down with that sudden wail, and most of her crew with her, never to rise again till the last summons to sea and land to give up the dead that are in them. But some few struggling figures were still to be seen, wrestling with the last agony, where she had sunk; and we saw all of those that could be reached dragged into the boat, which then made for the shore again. We gave one simultaneous gasp and shriek as the ship settled down ; and when all was done that could be done, I looked in Una's face for the x'eflection of my own dismay. Then recollection came—the living must be cared for now. \" Mr Glynne,\" I said, \"Una and I will go home and get all ready to receive those\n",

The man who could have inspired and retained the affection of a woman like Marj, and a servant Kke Bentinck, must have had in him much to love and esteem. His patriotism does not ap2)ear to have been a strong point in his character. Whatever he had belonged to his native Holland ; with England he never identified himself, and though he did much for her, and her blood ran in his veins, he neither loved her nor was loved by her. But even his regard for Holland was subservient to the stronger passion of his hatred for France, an enmity which was present with him even on his deathbed. The chief aim of his life seems to have been to form a great coalition of the European nations against France ; and England benefited by him, not because he loved her, and above all things desired her welfare, but rather because she was necessary to his political schemes. He makes his appearance as an actor on the stage of English history in 1687, when in his thirty-seventh year. He is described as slight in form, with an eagle eye, a thoughtful brow, and a cheek furrowed by sickness and care. In 1688 William and Mary were proclaimed in London, which was loud in its professions of loyalty to the new sovereigns. William of Orange was apparently in a proud and enviable position ; but \" uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,\" and the new king was surrounded with difficulties and anxieties of various kinds. A keen observer, too, of human affairs, he was fully prepared for a reaction in the popular favour, nor had he long to wait for it. The two great parties in England were again at war with each other. The Tories clung to the hope of a restoration of the Stuart dynasty, and only accepted William as the lesser of two evils. The Whigs welcomed him, but merely as the leader of a party ; and had no mind that he should assert himself as the sovereign of the entire nation. He was beset with difficulties inseparable from the position he now occupied as the ruler of a great country, passing through a crisis in its religious and political history. He took upon himself the direction of foreign affairs. \" The revolution had on a sudden placed England in a situation in which the ser-vices of a great minister for foreign affairs were indispensable to her. William was admirably qualified to supply that in which the most accomplished statesmen of the kingdom were deficient. He had long been pre-eminently distinguished as a negotiator. The clue without which it was perilous to enter the vast and intricate maze of Continental politics was in his hands.\" He chose his ministers for the home government Avith great impartiality, not excluding any who professed themselves willing to support the throne.

In 1690 he went over to Ireland ; his spirits rose at once on finding himself at the head of his troops, and he completely won the hearts of his men by the way in which he shared all their hardships,—\" sharply reprimanding officers who were so anxious to procure luxuries for his table, as to forget the wants of common soldiers.\" He made himself intimately acquainted with each regiment, and his pleasant looks and sayings are said to have been long remembered. William's army consisted of about 36,000 men. He determined to attack the Irish without delay, though in so doing he acted contrary to the opinion of some of his officers, Schomberg in particular, who thought it was too hazardous an experiment. On the 1st July was fought the battle of the Boyiie. The king had been wounded by a chance shot when leaving his breakfast-table the day before, but though obliged in consequence to hold his sword in his left hand, he led his men into the hottest part of the sight. Schomberg and Walker both lay dead on the field, when, just as the battle raged the fiercest, William, coming up with the left wing, decided the fate of that important day. On another occasion, at the battle of Landen, he displayed the same valour, consideration, and coolness, and though the result was then very difierent, and he was disastrously defeated, his nobility of character was as conspiciious in misfortune as in success. His unconquerable spirit rose to the occasion, and he set to work without delay to repair, as far as might be, his defeat, and collect his scattered troops. Of personal ambition, the desire of vain glory and self aggrandizement, he seems to have had but little; he did great things, and desired great things, but more, it would seem, in order that he might work out what he believed to be the divine purpose and the salvation of Europe, than from any other motive. Even his hatred to France, deeply and strongly as it no doubt entered into his personal feelings, proceeded from his conviction that she was the deadly enemy and the great obstacle to European freedom and equality, which he conceived to be in danger of utter destruction from the weight of her power and ambition. The historian Fronde, in writing of Mary Queen of Scots, remarks—\" Mary Stuart was chiefly interested in herself, and she was without the strength of self command, which is taught only by devotion to a great cause.\" Now this devotion to a great cause seems to us to be one of the keys to William's character and actions. Of the calm wisdom and unselfish consideration with which he acted on many occasions, aud in trying and perplexing circumstances, many instances are recorded.\n",

She had been crying, I was sure of that, for the tears were still shining on her cheeks and in her eyes, but what a wealth of happiness looked out from below the wet lashes 1 How tender were the hands that did the menial office ! Many a rich man, tended by \"gallant gay domestics\" might have envied the weary toiler in deep waters such proud, loving service. Off came the last boot with a vigorous tug, and then Alice threw her arms round him once more, as if she could hardly believe she had him again, and I turned from the window—she did not want me now. I went on to Mrs Wingate's, where Bob was receiving an ovation, all the empty labour of the dark night forgotten in the joy of reunion. And after rejoicing with them, T turned my steps homeward, having promised Una to be back soon. No sooner had I turned the corner from the path to the cottages into the low growth of pines near the cliff, than I was aware of a man approaching from the direction of the Glynne's house. A cigar was tainting the morning air, and the smoker of the same was Captain Maryon. He recognised me at once, and came up with outstretched hand, leaving his cigar to smoulder among the dry pine-needles by the way. \" Glad to see you out after last night. Miss Ferguson,\" said he. \" I hope you were none the worse for it?\" \" Mr Glynne was, I hear,\" I replied. \" No, thank you, we caught no cold.

She was walking round the garden waiting for me, for we were to pay a visit together before lunch, and, after the manner of Bunyan's pilgrims, as she walked on her way she sang. How I wished she had not been chanting \" Si tu savais \" so near the gate. My companion knew her voice at once, I saw, and looked most wistfully up the path to the house ; and just as I was hardening my heart to say good morning, Una was beside us. Charming she looked, with her little sealskin cap contrasting the bright hair underneath it, and her cheeks freshened by the wind. Charming, and I was not alone in my thought. Captain Maryon's eyes fastened upon her at once, with that look of admiration which stamps a man's character so quickly. There was a warning bale-fire in each of the \" Corsair's \" eyes as he looked at Una, but T forgot their evil light in a sudden conviction that came over me, burned in upon my brain as if by a lightning-flash. I had seen them before. Not in a bad dream, one of those in which we are haunted by a face we hate with wicked eyes and cruel mouth, which pursues and all but overtakes us in the land of visions. No, as Heine says— \" Sie waxen dieselben Augen, Die mir so elend gemacht.\" They were the eyes that had once looked brightly, beguilingly, tenderly, into mine ; then coldly and carelessly, till I saw them no more save in dreams, where they grew out of the darkness night after night, gazing with their old dead dearness into mine; till I prayed God in His mercy to take them away and let me rest. Why had they come back now 1 Or were these ten years a dream, and this the waking reality 1 Every drop of blood in my body seemed to rush to my heart, and I felt cold and sick in the morning sunshine. I held out my hand instinctively. \" Good morning,\" I said, \" we have an engagement, and must go. Come, Una.\" He thought me abrupt no doubt, but I did not feel we were safe till I got into the house. \" What is the matter, Molly, darling ?\" said Una. \" You are as white as a sheet, and shaking too. Sit down, and I'll get you a glass of wine.\" \" I don't want it, child,\" I said. \" We'll be off in a few minutes, I feel knocked up, that's all.\" \" Last night has been too much for you,\" said Una. \"Why do I drag you\n",

BEHOLD me in Lizzie's room, somewhat later in the day, with my head on my old nurse's knee. Her long service had made her more like a friend than a servant; and to me it was a great comfort, when suffering from a bad headache, to let down my hair, which was heavy, and increased the pain when fastened up, and listen to her quaint racy talk, in the first voice I had grown used to in my childhood. \" Miss Mary,\" quoth she, as she smoothed down my hair, \" ye're unco like your mother the night.\" \" Like my mother, Lizzie,\" I replied, \" every one says I am the image of papa. I can see it myself.\" \" Maybe, Miss Mary; but ye'll no deny that I that was her foster-sister, and kent her frae a bairn, should ken whether her bairn be like her or no. It's no ilka day ye're like her either, Miss Mary; it's times like this, when ye're in pain, and your eyes look heavy and dark, that I could maist think it was my Miss Mary come back again. Weel I wot she's better where she is, and where I hope to be or long. The Word says there's nae death, neither sorrow nor crying, neither shall there be ony mair pain.\" I felt a hot drop trickling down my cheek as she spoke. This mother, who was to me but a vision, so faintly remembered, so dimly descried, had she too suffered as I suffered now 1 I could not forbear a question. \"Why do I only remind you of my mother at such times as this, Lizzie 1\" I said. \" Was mamma sad? Why did she suffer? what did she want?\" \" Aweel, my dear, she wanted what many a woman wants a' her life, and lives her threescore and ten years without, but she couldna, and so she died.\" \" Tell me, Lizzie,\" I still pled, \" I want to know about her, my own mother. You know best about her, you loved her more than anybody, except papa, I suppose.\" \" I'll tell ye, Miss Mary,\" said Lizzie, after a pause, \"be it for harm or for gude. It canna do ony harm noo, and ye'll promise me no to tell to any one what none knows but yoursel' and me.\" Of course I promised, and what is, perhaps, more uncommon, I kept my promise, too; but you, O reader, shall be let into our confidence. o\n",

      "146 THE ATTEMPT. ''I maun go back many a year, Miss Mary,\" Lizzie began; \"back to the place where I was reared, and where they made me servant to my dear mistress, your mother that's gone. I kenna what ails the lassies noo; they've nae suner got ae place than they're wild for anither, where there's mair men, or less wark, or better air, as they say, the giddy gomerals. I was a proud lass when they tauld me Miss Mary Ferguson wanted me for her maid. Ye ken she was your father's cousin. Miss Mary, thoiigh no his first cousin. And many's the time we had waded about the shore, and fished frae the rocks, and hunted for brambles thegither. My mother was her nurse, and she and I were nigh the same age ; and she's often tauld me that in auld times fosterbrothers and sisters were ilk ither's best friends. * We suld aye be friends,' she said. '\"I have no sister, and you have none, Lizzie M'Pherson ; but when I grow up, you shall be my bower maiden, like fair Annette's, you mind, Lizzie. \" Come to my bower, my bower-maidens, And dress to me my hair. Where'er ye laid a plait before, See ye lay nine times mair.\" Your hair and mine look well together, Lizzie.' And then she wad tak a lang lock of my hair, that was lint-white then. Miss Mary, and glinted in the sun, and twist it wi' her ain, where the shadows aye lay deep and dark like the shadows in the pools at Hartly Linn, where she and I put rowans in our hair, and keeked in to see how bonnie they looked, langsyne. We were sae much thegither even when we were aulder, that the folks about Hartness used to ca' us Bessie Bell and Mary Gray. The auld laird, that's your mother's uncle, ye ken. Miss Mary, was gey and angry ance when he heard our names joined thegither like that, and said his niece had lowered hersel' till ilka lass about the town might ca' her neebor. \" But I trow your mother cam round him at last, and gat me for her maid when we were baith aughteen. Weel I mind the day when I gaed up to Hartness Holmes, and my Miss Mary showed me her bonnie room, wi' her father's sword ower the mantel. He was killed, ye ken. Miss Mary, in India, when she was a year axild, and your grandmother followed him in a month. Her picture was there too, sweet and fair and bonnie, bvit no like my Miss Maiy except the een. \" And there I lived. Miss Mary, till the Holmes was anither hame to me. There I was the day they telt me that Rob Andrews' boat had gone down ae nicht like the last ane, and a' on board perished. I didua greet, Miss Mary, for I couldna think it was true, or that my Rob could be cauld and stark at the bottom o' the Firth, and me sitting in your mother's room wi' my hands afore me.\n",

Whiles I wonder if the sea of glass will ever be like the Firth on a sunny morning, wi' your mother sitting gathering shells, and the clear water wimpling to the shore, and Rob's boat, wi' the sunshine on the sails, when I strained my een to see him as it cam' in. Onyway, I had done wi' thinking of marriage frae that day, and I set my heart on my young mistress. And at last. Miss Mary, when I had been twa years at the Holmes, and the a\\ild lady was dead, and Miss Mary keeping house for her uncle, I heard frae the servants, and then frae your mother hersel', that her cousin James was coming hame frae India, and to stay at the Holmes. I dinna ken how it was, but even then I felt as if his coming was something by ordinar'. Your mother was unco quiet and still as she grew iip; but I could see, that kent her, that this visit pleased and excited her. Ye see she had lived a retired life, and never seen mony people, and she had heard about her cous LQ frae the time she was a bairn. \" He was left an orphan like hersel', a few years afore she was born, but his father left money eneucli to set him up and educate him ; and ance he was started in the world he was sure to get on. And he had a taste for India, and for being a doctor ; sae, though Hartness had a livin' and a kirk ready for him, he wadna tak it, but he took his degree, I think they ca' it, and to India he went. And noo he was comin' liame, and the auld laird was his next of kin, and sae he was to mak his hame at the Holmes. Servants hae their clashes and clavers, ye ken. Miss Mary, and a wlieen o' them wad hae it that he was comin' hame for his cousin; naething wad serve them but that Hartness had planned it a' to hae them twa settled thegither or he died. I winna say he had, and I winna say he hadna, but I was in a bleeze to hear them talk as if my mistress was to be handed frae ane to anither, ohn' her ain word or wish in the matter. Onyway he cam'; and if Hartness had ony thoughts o' settlin' his niece on his cousin, it settled itsel'. \" The master's weel-faured yet. Miss Mary, but he was braw and bonnie when ho was aucht-and-twenty, and cam' to Hartness.\" \" Tell me what he was like, Lizzie,\" said I eagerly. \" Aweel, ye ken ye're like him. Miss Mary, only he was tall, and broad in the shouthers, and his hair was light brown and curly, no half sae dark as yours, and his een were like a gled's, as they are yet.

And I needna tell ye how the days passed, in the linn and in the woods, and in the gardens, till naebody but mysel' but thought and said in themselves it might be that it was a match, and Hartness's plan wad answer weel after a'. \" But I didna think sae, Miss Mary. Your mother looked young for her age ; she had seen naething o' the warld, as folks say, and her cousin was a man while she was still a bairn ; and noo and then it cam ower my mind that she was giving a' she had, and getting naething but kindness and care instead. \" Weel, I had maist rather we had baith been drooned in the linn when we were blythe bairns and nae trouble was near us, than seen what was coming on my mistress, and I could do nocht. But I aye thought Mr James, as they ca'd him at the Holmes, might mean mair than he seemed to mean ; and my mistress said nocht to me, but I saw her whiles sitting idle, her that had aye been busy, and eh ! but she took lang looks ower the sea, and her een were wistfu' and heavy, like your ain, Miss Mary. \" At length the day cam',—weel I mind it,-—when the master, your father I mean, had been awa at St Andrews for three weeks or sae, and your mother was unco dowie wi' missing him, that a leddy came to see Hartness. She cam' frae St Andrews, and it wasna ilka day we had visitors at the Holmes, as ye may guess, sae she was pressed to stay a' night, and my Miss Mary and she had a lang talk. And when she was gaue, soul sa' her chattering tongue, my mistress sat in her room as if she hadna the heart to stir. And I looked at her, and the end of it was, Miss Mary, that when 1 had seen her gang doon the stair to the wee i\"oom, where she and Mr James read and sang thegither, as if her heart made her very feet heavy, that used to be sae light, I gaed after her. Ye maun ken that this room I speak o' opened into a bit glass house, a conservatory ye ca't, and I saw her gang in there. She sat doon on the floor, and then she began to greet as if her heart wad break, and I couldna stand it, Miss Mary. Sae I said, 'gin she wadna tell me what ailed her, I could guess ; and I had next to naebody in the world I lo'ed but the sel' of her, and it wad do her muckle gude 'gin she wad tell me, that wad tell ower as muckle o' what she tauld me as the wa' or thae geraniums, and maybe be able to help her some gate, whilk they couldna do.

I mind every word she said, Miss Mary; for while she said it, wi' her head on my breast, and the crimson up to her hair—sair shamed was she, puir lamb—I raised my een to the glass door atween Miss Mary's study and the greenhouse where we were, and 1 saw your father. \"And I saw, Miss Mary, I kent, he had heard a'. His face was as white as a sheet, and he caught my look, and then he reddened, for a' his sun-bum, as red as my puir mistress. I kenna how it was, but I saw it a' in a gliff. Your mother couldna see him, for her back was to the door, while I sat facing it ; and I signed to him as well as I could, without moving, though my heart was beating like a mell, your mother might hae felt it but for her ain sobs, and by the mercy o' God, he got out o' the room without her hearing a sound. He slippit out like a ghaist, Miss Mary, and I'll ne'er forget his face. \"I quieted your mother as weel's I could, and I gat her awa' to her ain room ; and she didna see the master till dinner, and then she thought he was but newly back. \"And the next day.

' Oh Lizzie,' she said ' oh Lizzie,' and then I kenned it a'. She threw her arms round me, and grat like a bairn ; but I kenned it wasna as it had been the day before ; a' the world was changed for her, and your father had asked her to be his wife, and she never doubted, bless her sweet heart. \" ' You know, Lizzie,' she said ' that was all a story that I told you yesterday, the gossip of St Andrews ; why did I believe it for a mraute 1 It was me he loved all the time, how can I thank God enough 1' \" It took awa' my breath.

And day by day, Miss Mary, I watched your mother, my dear mistress, to see if she sand out o' hersel' what I wad hae died afore telling her. \"And slowly, slowly, she sand it at last. It was like the waukin' frae a dream, like what I felt for years after Rob was lost. I wad be standing on the shore waiting on his boat, and see him as clear as I see you, coming closer, closer, and then as I felt his hands in mine at last, and heard his voice, a' at ance I wad wauken, and wish for death, for I was a rebellious and heart-broken lassie, and my pain was sairer than when I heard he was dead. \"And even sae, I think, when yoixr mother did ken what she had done, her grief was waur to bear than it had been yon day in the greenhouse. She never said a word, but I could see. The master was kindness itsel'; but I saw, and eh but she sune saw too, that he gave her sae muckle kindness and care e'en because he had naething else to give. And it brak her heart, Miss Mary. Tt wasna his wyte, and it wasna hers. I aye thought when ye came. Miss Mary, that it would mak a' the difference. There are women who can live in their bairns and ask for nae mair, but she wasna ane o' them. She lo'ed ye e'en mair for his sake than for your ain ; and though I saw her een light up when she saw how proud he was of you, year after year everything that held her here seemed to grow looser, and she died when ye were live years auld. But she ne'er tauld me what she was thinking o' again. Miss Mary, though I could read her face like a book. An' she died. Miss Mary, in spite of a' the master's kindness and reverence, for the love of him, as surely as yon puir lassie Elaine, that Miss Una read to me about, died for Sir Lancelot; as surely as she wad hae died 'gin he had left her for yon leddy at St Andrews, that was married a month after him. \" She loved him better than her life, better than onything m the world. Many's the time I sat and grat by mysel', and thought how the Lord could mak it up to my puir mistress in the life to come. \"The master was spared ae thing, he never kent that she had found out the truth.

No, I was not to be killed by such sorrow, but had there not been a time when death seemed the best friend that could have come to me, when my wild weary heart had longed for it as for great good ! Lizzie knew nothing of that. She may have guessed at something, but that was all. \" Aweel, Miss Mary, the master grieved sorely and sadly for my mistress. I mind when she sent for me the day she died. I cam' to the door afore she was ready to speak to me, and the curtains hid me from her and the master, sae I heard her words before I thought. ' Good-bye, James,' she said; and though her voice was weak, it grew stronger, as if her love had leapt up last of a' in her puir heart to tell itsel' afore she died. ' You'll many again, James, and she may be dear and good. I shall love her because you do ; but oh ! my darling, she'll not love you as I have loved. That was all, dear. I wasn't beautiful or clever or good enough for you, but I love you better than my life.' Then her voice grew fainter and fainter. Miss Mary, and she kissed him and lay down and sent for you. Do ye mind ?\" \" Only as if it were a dream, Lizzie, but I do remember. Poor mamma ! oh, poor mamma!\" \" And syne. Miss Mary, as ye ken, the master sauld the Holmes and went to the Indies again; and when he cam' hame, he met the sister o' his auld love at General Hilary's, and he married her, for a' the difference in age. Eh ! but she was bonnie and weel-liked, bonnier than Miss Una, dear lamb, and ye ken the rest.\" And Lizzie went on knitting, and I sat and pondered. How strange it is to feel, at such times, that the hearts we think of as calmly at rest have beaten as wildly as our own ! I sat thinking in the firelight, till all at once I saw Una's bright head flash along the pine-shaded path that led to the garden, and it struck me that a cup of tea would seem to her a necessary of life when she came in. Accordingly I twisted up my hair, and asked Lizzie to go and see about it, coming back with an effort from my mother's life into my own, while I went to the front-door to meet my child. 0. M.\n",

How fatigued you must be ! Really such an adventure ; Rose and I could not rest till we had seen you, and heard all about it. Of course, Harry (Harry is 'Arry with his mother, but his sisters know better) told us what he could, but that wasn't much, and Captain Maryon made light of it altogether ; lay—1 mean military men, always do that.\" Here Rose broke in upon the measured tones of her sister. \" Tell us all how and about it, Una. It's always so with me, if any sun is going, I miss it is sure as a gun. Didn't I say last night I would take a cigarette with Maryon and Harry when they went out. Violet's pet was there, and nothing but chant practising going on. They covdd have dispensed with me, I've no doubt, though the pets liave an unaccountable taste for my company. It's a variety, I suppose, and they know what a brick I am for decorations. But my mother was in a wax, well, fume, if you like the word better (/ see you, Molly), and wouldn't hear of it, so instead I took to chaffing the Reverend Ambrose. Oh ! didn't I give it him about his fastings and scourgings and hair-shii'ts. I declared I saw a corner of one below his white choker, though he does blacken himself nearly up to the chin. And just as I had dismissed him with a benediction, and driven the mother to the verge of frenzy, in they came and told us about the wreck. And I said I'd have given the hair off my head to have seen it (N.B., it's all my own)—so tell us all about it, like a good child.\" Hitherto the introduction of a word edgewise had been quite out of the question ; but now we began to relate our experiences, dwelling much on Captain Muiyon's coolness and courage. \" If it hadn't been for him, even those poor fellows would have been lost,\" said Una. \"Ah yes, he's no end of a good fellow,\" quoth the unblushing Rose. \"We never saw him till a few days ago, but I'm in love with him now, and so would Vi be, if she could spare time from the clericals.

It appeared, from Papa's account, that Mr Brand Hilary had been on his way from Mexico in a Spanish ship, when they were driven out of their course by storms, and so cast ashore. His father and he were now quite reconciled, and indeed would have been so long before ; but for years Brand Hilary had been leading a Bohemian life without once visiting England. Anything of the cause which made him a wanderer, my father did not seem to know; at least he said nothing of it. I could not help thinking of what he had said when he 6rst opened his eyes, which only Una and I had heard. How long I have been in telling of a night and a day. But have you never noticed how sometimes a crowd of events seem to be compressed into some such brief period, making a sudden change in your life, which will then slow calmly on, undisturbed for a long time by anything out of its usual course 1 That evening I spoke of Frank Laurie ; and my father told me to invite him to come to us as soon as they could spare him at home. *' That will be some time in May, and you can show him how to row, Una,\" said he. The eleven o'clock appointment with Una, that the Gl3mnes had made, related to a ride to be taken next morning ; and punctual to the hour Rose cantered up to the gate with her brother, and, yes—the Corsair in attendance. Una was ready. A horse for her was one of the indulgences my father permitted us at St Michael's, and my quieter tastes were consulted by the gift of the most charming of small pony caiTiages. Mr Glynne threw himself off his steed in headlong haste, blushing like a l)eony as Una asked after his health, with a little mischievous solicitude which amused me. The \" lovely Rose \" called out in dulcet tones, as he helped Una into the saddle,— \" You needn't suppose he is restored, Mary. This morning we should never have got him up but for my sending him a message that Captain Maryon would escort us both unless he bestirred himself. And look at him now, the pale spectre of his former self. Mightn't it be better for you not to try going on, Harry j this hectic flush is so deceptive?

Sweets to the sweet, but a little sugar goes a great way with me.\" \" Well, Una, sugar may be a drug in the market,\" I said ; \" but stupid as poor Henry Glynne is, I like him better than the Corsair. Mind, this is all a mere matter of first impressions, but I didn't like his face.\" Una looked consideringly at me, then at the fire, as if she saw fancied Corsairs in tlie red heart of the coals, then again at me. \" Neither do I,\" she said slowly. We were both silent after that, till we adjourned to the drawing-room. Later on we went down to the pier, to feel the keen blast from the sea ; meeting some people we knew by the way, invalids creeping home as the wind grew raw, and Violet Glynne, as we passed the church wicket, coming out from an extra service. We spoke no more of Captain Maryon that night; but oblivion of his existtence was impossible. Expeditions had to be made into the country to get the first snowdrops and daffodils, and the great moonlight-coloured primroses that were to be found as April went on, in the green lanes and woods inland, though among our sandy pleasure grounds and winding chines, nothing told of spring but the golden gorse-heaps and curling bracken buds among the pines. My little ponycarriage came into requisition to carry luncheon-baskets, to be emptied and filled again with flowers, and Rose Glynne and Henry would ride, and Una would do the same, though she often took a place beside Violet and me instead. And into all these quiet amusements, these spring twilight drives, and gossips, and songs, did Captain Maryon, of the 11th Hussars, enter with an apparent measure of enjoyment, no man saying him nay. He was going to London in May, and so were the Glynnes, and so— \" The present moment is our ain, The niest we never saw,\" seemed to be the motto of the whole party, and with it this chapter must end.

      "THE ATTEMPT. 179 under the escort of—one gentleman ! It was at St Andrews, where the fierce intensity of the Golf Mania is held sufficient to excuse any amount of ungallant behaviour. I am happy to say, however, that our solitary cavalier behaved with a courage and a presence of mind marvellous to behold; distributing his attentions with the utmost gallantry and impartiality, and, with a wisdom beyond his years, keeping always in close attendance upon the chaperone. He was an undergraduate of Trin. Coll. Cam.; and I am happy to avail myself of this public opportunity of testifying my admiration for his gallant behaviour. The most trying incident of the day occurred when the ordeal seemed almost over, and we were within a mile of home. At this point a heavy shower of rain came on. The chaj^erone had an umbrella; so had the undergraduate; but among the eleven young ladies of the party, not one had even a parasol. At this terrible discovery, the unfortunate young man for the first time realised the full horror of his position; he cast a despairing glance along the row of hats and feathers, muslin dresses and gossamer _y?c7ms, and at last placing his umbrella in the hands of the plainest and most uninteresting damsel of the party, he walked off at a rapid pace beside the chaperone. But it is high time that I had come to the second division of my subject—the Picnic Proper. This, when well managed, is, in my opinion, the most enjoyable of the three classes I have mentioned. It should be larger than the Picnic Undeveloped, and should be engineered by the joint eiforts of several families. The Picnic Proper, too, must not be a walking expedition ; the place of the celebration must be reached either per carriage or per train; and in the proper disposition of the party in the different vehicles lies one of the most formidable difficulties of the Picnic Proper. It won't do to let Aunt Betsy go in the same carriage as young Adolphus Ailington, for he enrages her with his \" airs,\" and she makes him miserable with her very visible contempt.

I could only see the outline of his face, set and stern, looking ten years older, and a life-time wearier and sadder. The pain it gave me I cannot tell. He grew dear to me as a younger brother might have been in those few minutes, by that mysterious sympathy which arises between those who bear alike the signs and tokens of \"Our Lady of pain.\" \" Don't tell me of it,\" I said. \" Why should we dig up our old troubles out of their graves 1 new ones are born to us every day.\" \" It would ease my mind,\" he said, \" you don't know how much. Have patience with me, and don't reject my confidence ; I have a reason for what I am going to say. I fell in love with Mary Evans, and was always hiring her father's boat, and going out with him, just that I might see her come down to the shore to meet him, and wade into the surf with her little white feet shining on the sand. She will never wade to meet him again, never any more. She was lovely and she was good. Miss Ferguson, and as sweet and pure as a blossom on a tree,—a girl for a man to love and treasure all his life. No one could say anything against her but that she was a fisherman's daughter, who should have married a fisherman, I suppose, a stupid brute, who would fling her what he had brought in to sell, and then go to sleep with a curse, thrash her when he was drunk, and neglect her when he was sober. I don't say they all do that; many of them do. Mary had plenty of wooers, but she cared for none of them, and before very long I saw she did care for me. How I used to watch for her coming out of that dark old liole of a cottage, with the sunshine in her hair, and her blue eyes lighting up like lamps. I worshipped her more than I might have done a girl of my own station. I worshipped her innocence, her ignorance, her tenderness ; everything she did or said seemed beautiful to me, and we were both so young. For a while we seemed to think of nothing beyond our love ; no one knew anything of it, and we used to meet in the evenings in a place among the cliffs that no one knew, as we thought, but ourselves. I used to tell her no lady would ever be so lovely as mine, and repeat poetry to her, and in fact, we were as blest and as foolish, I suppose, as most lovers; till one day my father and I were sitting after dinner, I meaning to slip out later, though it was a rainy night, on the chance that Mary might get out to the tryst, when my father began,—' I say.

You're young yet, and there's plenty of time, but I daresay I've kept you too much at home with me, and you haven't had the chance of seeing the sort of girl that would suit you. One like your mother, my boy, with a sweet voice and a fair face. She would have helped you to choose a wife better than an old soldier like me, but God's will be done.' \" Mind, I was young and ignorant, Miss Ferguson, and had an idea that the woman you loved was the woman for you; in my stupidity, I didn't know that she was precisely the one whom you couldn't, shouldn't, and might not have. So I looked straight at my father, and said—'I've chosen my wife.' \" The governor opened his eyes, as well he might, knowing that since I came home I had not seen a lady except the clergyman's wife. ' And where has your choice lighted, my son?' he said, 'I don't know a single suitable match within twenty miles, and you are too young, besides, to choose well.' \" Then of course it all came out, like the cork of a bottle of champagne. ' It's Mary Evans, father,' I said, ' old James Evans' daughter.' \" What else I said I can't remember, but no doubt my father thought it very little to the purpose. The great fact was out. \" ' You've made a fool of yourself, Brand,' he said, ' a very great fool. We all do the same at some time of our lives. I did the same when I was a poor sub, with my pay on my back, and went hankering after a woman who would as soon have married a drill-sergeant; only I went too high, and you've gone the other way, I'm glad of what you say about her parents knowing nothing of it, they are too honest to try to trick you into a low marriage; and as for the poor child herself, she is a child and you are a boy, and you will forget each other in a month or two. Therefore you will promise, on your honour as a gentleman, before you leave this room, never to see her again.' \" Of course you can guess what I said, but my father is not made of wax; and though I was too like him to be afraid of him, I began to feel he had the best of it, the dream was melting away. Still I held on to it; I said I should be of age in two months, and then might do what I liked. To which he replied, that I might not only do what I liked, but live where I liked after that, but that I must be aware, that if I chose to marry against his wish, he was not bound to provide for me. At length he paused, and then said—' The fact is, that knowing you to be an obstinate boy, I have bten trying to talk as if you were a reasonable man. The girl's parents are the peo])le for me to go to, they are as proud in their own way as anybody, and will take more pains to keep her out of your way\n",

Now, mind, it is your own obstinate folly that forces me to appeal to them, which I had much rather not do.' \"Well, I got away at last, and off I went through the drizzle to the tryst. I thought I would try and see her once more, though I began to feel desperate. But though I waited and waited till late at night, there was no sign of her; some one had seen us together, and told her father and mother, and there was no further need of my father's interference. For she was a dutiful little soul, and I believe had almost forgotten the difference of rank between us; and it was a matter of course that a fisherman's courtship should begin with the girl and end with her parents. Well, I tried all I could to see her, but in vain ; she was watched over and kept at home. Only one day I saw her face just for a moment at the window of the cottage, as it was getting dark, and I was coming home from a hard day's shooting,— I tried to weary myself out in body, as I was weary and sick at heart, God knows,— and there was hardly any light outside, but everything inside was as clear as day with a turf fire, and Mary was standing near the window, with the light in her face. It was the last time I was ever to see her alive, and oh, how changed she was, her blue eyes had great wan circles under them, and her cheeks looked pale even in the red firelight. I looked and looked till my heart ached,—she wasn't a child any longer, but a woman, with all her womanhood turned into pain. Oh, to see her, and be so near her, and yet divided ! I saw her mother was asleep, and her father was out with the boat, and I couldn't help going to the window and beckoning. \"She saw me and sprang to the window, my poor little darling, with all the light coming back to her eyes, and even the colour to her face. I had just time to whisper, for there was only a chink of the window open, and I dared not make any noise. I told her my birthday was the next week, there would be a great to-do, but all I cared for was that then I should be my own master; that night she was to meet me at the tryst, and next morning we should be married at C , and be off to America. I had hardly time to speak, and she had none to answer ; she put her dear hand through the chink and I kissed it. I must hurry over the rest, for I shall tire you, and it's not a pleasant tale. My birthday came, and a wild wet day it was. There was to be a dinner of the tenantry, and all manner of rejoicings, and I remember poor old Grace coming in to waken me in the morning, and bless me; in short, I remember the whole day as a charming and blessed anniversary.

The rain was driving against the window, and the wind whistling and howling like mad the whole time, and I was thinking how the fast-sailing vessel, the \" Orion,\" destined to sail from Liverpool for the United States the evening after next, would creak and lurch while my little bride and I were sailing to the New World. I declare I was ' fey,' as the Scotch call it, only it was not my death that my goings on portended. I got up and returned thanks when my health was drunk, though I had never done such a thing in my life before as make a speech of any kind. 1 never stopped for a word. I filled my glass and drank it off to my future bride, whoever she might be, and I laughed and joked with the farmers about my destiny being settled for me so soon. I saw my governor staring at me. 1 had been as dull as ditch-water for weeks, sitting silent for hours, so I suppose he thought I had taken rather too much. At length things came to a conclusion, and it was quite dark when I started off for the tryst. I've been to the place since I came home, it isn't far from the Devil's Elbow ; by the way, that is a rock of good omen for me. It was a hollow among the rocks, open towards the sea, but inaccessible unless you knew the ^way along the cliffs. I knew my way well, and I went along whistling. When I got there the rain was falling pretty heavily, and the wind had gone down. Well, I waited and waited, till I thought Mary would never come. I strained my eyes along the path that led from the village, but not a sign of her could be seen ; she had gone a longer journey and made another tryst. At last I saw, as I thought, something white on the shore, just at the edge of the waves, for the tide was rising. It was so dark that I risked my life going down, as I did almost head-foremost, but I was not to die then. I got to the shore in a few minutes, how I don't know, for I was half wild with a sort of vague fear, and then I saw the white thing was a woman, and the foremost waves were lifting her, and wandering round her. I needn't tell you who it was, Miss Ferguson, you must know by this time. She had fallen off the cliffs in the dark on her way to meet me. I must have been half mad. I felt for her heart, and it had stopped beating, she had fallen on a sharp stone, and I could see the wound on her brow. I kejjt saying to myself, ' She is dead, she is dead,' like a child trying to learn a hard lesson, for I could not believe it. \" You must remember how young I was; and when I thought of living without her, I could not bear it.

I felt as if his interference had wrecked my happiness, and I sailed for America as soon as I was able, not, however, without seeing him ouce more. He was so melted at my sorrow that he bore much from me, but my whole heart was fall of bitterness, and I told him I could bear home no longer.

From that day I felt we were friends in reality. Brand Hilary and I. I have said that Captain Maryon remembei-ed him as a school-fellow at Harrow, and their acquaintance was soon renewed. They met at our house one evening, which I remember well; it was the first opportunity I had of contrasting then. Brand Hilary was sitting near me, beside the window, Una at a table at one side of the room, engaged in making tea for us and Elsie Harper, an old schoolfriend of hers who was staying with us, when Sarah the capless announced Mr Glynne and Captain Maryon. We rose, and I introduced the young men to each other. It was not till I had said—\" I believe you have met before,\" and Captain Mai-yon had held out his hand with the greeting—\" Well, Hilary, have you forgotten Harrow, old fellow 1 \" that Brand Hilary's face seemed to light up, and he returned the other's grasp of the hand heartily and kindly. I, remembering that he owed his life in some measure to the efforts of Captain Maryon, of which fact he was quite ignorant, was beginning to explain the same, without noticing the sound of a cab approaching, or a quick step up the walk, till all of a sudden, seeing Captain Maryon, who faced the window, open his eyes as if in astonishment, I turned round and beheld a chesnut-hued face, two very blue eyes, a middle-sized young man of merry countenance—in fact, Frank Laurie coolly stepping in at the open French casement behind me.

So I came off by night, telling mother that when the coast was clear T would come back, and here I am, bag and baggage. The syce, oh I mean the fellow with the cab, is bringing up the plunder; please introduce me to cousin \"Una.\" So, while Brand Hilary began to talk to his old schoolfellow, I took Frank across the room to where Una and Elsie were sitting, assisted by the Heir of Glynne, as Una sometimes called him, who was so nervous that the water he aimed at the tea-pot flooded the tray, and in short was on the point of being dismissed as incapable. Una rose to greet Frank, and held out her hand so cordially, that I saw a shade of resentment on the countenance of her unlucky little lover beside the table, that is to say, he looked rather aggrieved; and when Frank had taken the white fingers in his brown ones, and made the imusually brilliant remark—\" How d'ye do 1\" I got absorbed in inquiries about dear old Kedmains and the boys, and Frank's Indian experiences, and then my father came in, so I was taken up till the time for leave-taking came. Brand Hilary and the Captain shook hands, and made some appointment for next day, then both came to Una's corner to say good evening. Mr Glynne also I'ose. \" Good evening.

Perhaps you are not aware, Hilary, that had it not been for her efforts in your behalf, you might have been 'full fathom five' by this time.\" \" My eflibrts,\" said Una, \" what were they ?

THE more I thought of Brand Hilary and Louis Maryon (for such was the gallant hussar's name) together, the more strongly my preference turned towards the former. True, he was not so ready of speech, nor seemingly so alert in action, but there was an earnestness of purpose, a frankness of expression in his face utterly wanting in the other, handsome and gay and bold as it was. And Hilary's face was handsome too, with true Saxon beauty; fair of complexion though sunburnt, with hazel eyes that won upon you more and more daily by their truthful brightness, a square forehead and a firmly-set mouth, as sweet in its smiling as Una's own, and that great beauty, a well-formed chin. His was a quiet face, though it could light up, and often did ; but the other face was never still, never allowed you to look through the windows freely into the moods and tenses of the mind within. It was possible for it to inspire admiration, nay, affection, but confidence never, or so it seemed to me. And, as day by day I saw the eyes that were to me a memory and a fear settling more eagerly on Una, a dull dread of coming misfortune seemed to come over me. That evening of Frank's arrival, though Brand Hilary had tried to seem occupied with other things, I had seen how he, too, seemed to feel, even when he did not see, Una's every movement. Truly \" Like the moon, she made The ever-varying currents of the blood, According to her humour, ebb and slow,\" and I trembled to think that she held in her soft hands unconsciously, the happiness of the life her urgency had helped to save, and of the other that had been risked for its safety. I heard her laugh as Elsie and she ran lightly upstairs, having gathered some geraniums for their hair in the little greenhouse. Elsie was twitting her with little Mr Glynne's devotion, which, indeed, I saw was drawing to its natural close, i.e., an 2 B\n",

Una had shown him, as plainly as she could, the real state of the case, but I felt sure his elastic temperament would not be thoroughly discouraged by anything short of a point-blank \"No,\" which there was every likelihood of his receiving before long. But Una would only have laughed if I had told her that Brand Hilary who hardly spoke to her, who left the Corsair to hand her chair and search for her glove, was setting his heart upon her with a devotion which T could not but think would be true and lasting. Well, just then I had not much time for meditation, for it struck me that the dinner ought to be suited to Frank's peculiar tastes ; and then I remembered that seeing the days when Cousin Mary's tarts and cheese-cakes were objects eagerly coveted and devoured were gone by, possibly an extra good curry would be more to the purpose. This I commissioned Lizzie particularly to see after, as there was just time, and then came dinner, and many remembrances of old days, as I saw how the boy's face had changed into a man's, and yet kept the old expression in a bewildering way that confused my ideas every now and then. Then in the evening Una and Elsie sang the duets they had learned at Hampstead, in what they called \" old times,\" and Frank sat down by my work-table to talk, and tell me of his life and prospects, which last seemed to be decidedly bright. About nine o'clock there was a ring, and what Frank would have called \" a chit\" was brought in for me from Mr Glynne, saying he and Captain Maryon had managed to engage a large sailing-boat, big enough to hold their party and ours with all safety, and they hoped we would join them in a sail to Ilsley Bank, a pretty place on the coast several miles away. Mr Hilary had volunteered to assist in the navigation of said boat, and all would be in readiness about ten next morning, if we could come. Una and Elsie hastily left the piano, and the Ilsley Bank motion was carried nem. con. \" T suppose I must go, were it only as chaperone,\" I put in. \" Of course, Molly, it wouldn't be really sun without you,\" said Una, and she went to the window. \" There is going to be a gale,\" she said, \" what sun.\" \" There is going to be nothing of the kind,\" said Frank. \" Molly, are you as much afraid of the sea as you were long ago, or has familiarity bred contempt %\" \" I shall never be a good sailor,\" I said, \" I leave that to Una ; but if you'll drop a line to the clerk of the weather-office to let us have a dead calm, I don't mind.\" \" A dead calm, and a painted ship upon a painted ocean,\" said Una, \" how delightful !

Una was standing up in the stern, which had been brought close to the steps of the quay, taking our mufflings from Frank. How lovely she looked, with her upturned face, and the simple lines of her boating dress, a plain blue serge jacket and skirt, falling around her as she stood, one little foot just visible on the gunwale. Una's feet, by the way, were rather like those of the Queen of Spain, or the little feet which once \" Crept in and out, As if they feared the light.\" But I am stopping the whole boating-party in order to describe them. They descended into the stern, and the baskets were stored away, with loud calls for a kettle. \" Mary brought one,\" said Una ; \" half the sun is making afternoon tea at Ilsley Bank, all the smoke will go down the spout, and then how enjoyable it will be.\" \" Of course you've forgotten the cork-screw \" said Captain Maryon, \" if not, pray let some one drop it into the water ; no good ever came of a pic-nic party that had a cork-screw.\" \" Mind the bottles, Frank, you as nearly as possible set down that basket with a violence that would have smashed them altogether.\" This from me, while Frank protested his home-made ginger-beer, that nobody else would drink, was good enough for me in the old times, that were better than these. \"There goes the salt into the sea, coals to Newcastle,\" said Hose, as the unthrifty heir of Glynne, taking the last mentioned useful article from Una, let it drop over the side in a slight agitation which was rather to his credit than otherwise, instead of putting it into one of the baskets.

I hope nobody will ever ask me again. \" Till Hiddbrand comes ?\" \" Hlildbrand will never come. You are the best, Molly, worth twenty Hlildbrands. And I feel as if I had done wrong, and yet I never pretended to like him, you know I didn't. Well, I'll go to bed and try to forget about it.\" And so she did, and next morning was herself again ; and in the course of the day we heard that the Glynne family was preparing to go to London. The girls came to say good-bye ; they were not quite at their ease at first, but became quite cordial before they left. Captain Maryon, it seemed, was going too. \" But not quite so soon,\" said Bose. \" General Hilary has asked him to the Hall. If you'll believe me, it was only the other day that he heard the whole story of how his son was saved, and he came down at once to thank Maryon, and can't make enough of him.\" This was no good news for me.

Nor, I was sorry to see, could there be any doubt that the Captain meant to lay siege to Una, though he had more control over himself than the luckless heir of the Glynnes, and would not be rash. What I feared came upon me, for hardly a morning passed in that bright May weather, without the two young men from the Hall coming in to devise some plan for passing the day. The Glynnes had departed bodily, the girls in high spirits apparently, and General Hilary seemed much pleased with his giiest. One day he was talking him over with me. \" He is well connected, though he seems pretty much alone in the world ; his father was a brother of Sir Charles Maythorpe, who it seems changed his name on inheriting his estate, and his mother was Spanish; it is evident he has some foreign blood in his veins from his appearance. His father was stationed at Gibraltar, offended all his relations by his marriage, and then died ; so this lad was brought up in Spain, living at some sea-port town with his mother, till his uncle landed there by accident from his yacht, saw the boy, and recognised him by the fainily likeness.\" \" And what did he do 1 \" said I. Luckily it was nearly dark, for the familiar name, so long unheard, and once so dear above all others, had sent the hot blood to my cheeks and brow as in the old time. No need to ask why Captain Maryon's face had moved me so strangely now. The ghost of my old trouble had come back in the shape of a new one. \" What did he do 1 why, he found the boy living with apemirious old uncle of his mother's, she having died a month or two before, and so brought him home and educated him, and got him a commission, I suppose, and there he is. Now I must be going ; why, Mary, I must get the doctor to presciibe for you, your hand is like ice, and shaking too. What is the matter 1\" \" Nothing,\" I answered hastily, \" my hands are usually cold, it is no bad sign with me.\" And then I wont upstaii-s to think. \" Maythorpe, Charles Maythorpe.\" How the name brought back old times, that it was only pain to remember now. Was my feeling towards Maryon mere prejudice, an instinct I ought to disregard, or an intuition 1 \" Well,\" I thought, '' at any rate he and Brand are coming to dinner, but I hope, I do hope, he won't be here long.\" And that night Captain Maryon left the group at the piano and came up to me. \" You don't know how sorry I am, these pleasant evenings are at an end for me,\" he said, \" but my leave is up, and I have some affaii-s to attend to in London.

I can't leave without knowing whether I have any chance or not.\" It was out, and he stood looking half proud, half ashamed, and a whole tide of feelings came over me as I saw the look in his eyes, when they wandered half involuntarily over to Una. Then I saw Brand Hilary glance towards us, and start as if a new light had broken in upon him, and then rise abruptly and lean on the piano, talking to Elsie. I knew that lie knew, ' by tact of love,' what his friend was talking of, but there were Charles Maythorpe's eyes waiting for an answer,—restless, unsteady, but eager and evidently earnest, not to be evaded. \" I can tell you nothing,\" I said; \" pardon me, but you are almost a sti'anger, and though I cannot pretend not to have remarked your attention to Una, she is, I am sure, that is, I am nearly sure \" here I came to a full stop. \"She has no thoughts of me, that's likely enough,\" he said, \" and yet may I not see her to-morrow morning if I come ? \" I managed to bring out a sort of conditional acquiescence, and soon after Brand and Captain Maryon left, and I, in great trouble of mind, went to Una's room when I heard Elsie leave it.

I talked to him about the necessity of behaving better, and doing something for a livelihood, in both of which he readily concurred. But on my return next day with the offer of a place as apprentice to a painter who would take him on trial, he frankly stated that if he bound himself to anything he would just run away ! His aunt has tried to coerce him by refusing to give him food, but he seems not to care, and runs errand or holds horses for pence enough to buy food. Unfortunately, for such services he is often paid with a glass of whisky or a drink of beer. He is over fourteen, consequently too old to be forced to attend school, and as he has neither stolen nor begged, he cannot be sent to a Reformatory, which seems the only suitable place for him. Little Mary, the granddaughter, has proved a more hopeful subject. Her father, having gone to the country for work, left her with her grandmother. Mary's bright smile was hardly visible through the coating of dirt which covered her face at our first meeting. A hint that this might with advantage be removed was acted upon, and at my next visit I found she was a rosy-cheeked comely little maiden. She was anxious to get work, but had not proper clothes to enable her to look for a place. The committee gave her an order for some old clothes from the Association Office, and lent her money to buy a cotton dress. A green grocer engaged her as message girl, but finding her unsuitable from being unable to read or write, transferred her with a good character to a laundress, who was to teach her to wash and iron. Here too, however, her engagement came to an untimely end, for being set to turn a heavy mangle, the work brought on spitting of blood, which disabled her for some time. Her next start was more satisfactory. Our milkwoman has engaged her, and is much pleased with her. This winter she is to attend the Apprentices' evening classes for readmg and writing, for which she is to pay 6d. a month out of her own earnings, the Association paying a similar sum. She has already paid all the money for her dress. \" Samuel H. and his wife are the most respectable looking couple in my district; their room is a model of cleanliness and tidiness.

For some time she always assured me they wanted nothing, but on my urging an explanation of her not obeying the doctor's orders to take a daily walk, she told me her story. \" In consequence of an injury of the spine received in early life, she has never enjoyed good health, and sufiers besides in winter from bronchitis.

INTO the room I went, and there was Una sitting on the window-s Ul, her white dressing-gown streaming down to the floor. Her brush was in her hand, but the flood of yellow hair, whitened by the moonlight, was still hanging loose, and she was evidently engaged in meditation. \" I've got something to say to you, darling,\" said I. Wliereupon Una put me into the great motherly arm-chair, and sat down on the arm, expectant. \" Nothing's wrong, Molly 1\" \" Not wrong exactly,\" said I, \" but, dear Una, Captain Maryon said something to me to-night that troubled me very much.

If he calls in the morning, just that Mr Hilary may biing a message from the General to Papa, or fetch you the \"Saturday,\" and perhaps stays to luncheon, and strolls about in the afternoon, and then drops in to tea, surely on one of these occasions he may, by some rare accident, catch sight of me. Such things do happen.\" \" Hush, darling,\" I said, \" and don't laugh. I'm afraid Lizzie's adage about laughing before morning and crying before night will be fulfilled. Una, he has fallen in love with yon.\" A sudden silence fell between us. Una's head drooped till the yellow hair coiled on my lap and over my knee. I waited for her to speak, but nothing came. \" I thought it was best to tell you, sweet, for he will certainly come to-morrow, and I wished you to have a little time to think. Do you need it, Una 1 Darling, speak to me.\" I was so hungry for her answer, and yet so anxious to avoid Massing her decision by any prejudice which might be unfounded, that my heart was beating as it used to beat long ago. Still she was sUent. Could she really care for him ? I could not bear the suspense ; no lover ever waited more eagerly to hear his fate. I put my arm round her, and said again, \" Speak to me, Una.\" Then the silence broke into sobs. Una rarely cried, but now I felt the hot tears falling on my hand, and felt her quivering, as if some sorrow never felt till now had suddenly broken forth. \" Leave me, please, dear Molly,\" she said at last. \" No, I don't care for him; I never shall, in that way. Couldn't you tell him so, without my seeing him 1\" Such a deep satisfaction thrilled through my heart, that I could hardly wonder after the cause of Una's tears. They fell faster and faster, however. \" Una, what is the matter 1\" 1 said. \" You will melt away like your namesake.\" But Una got up and walked to the glass, and there veiling herself in a cloud of hair, began to brush vigorously. \" Everything is the matter to-night,\" she said, \" and nothing w Ul be the matter to-morrow, perhaps. But I won't see him.\" And I went away ; suspecting, however, that if Captain Maryon had set his heart on a personal interview, he would by no means be satisfied with my mediation in the matter. Sure enough he came in next day, as eleven o'clock was striking. I had spirited Frank and Elsie out of the way, and we were alone. \" T came to say good-bye,\" he said. \" Can I see your sister.

I paused, any woman would have paused, in keen pity and pain, before disappointing him. \" I am grieved to pain you, Captaia Maryon,\" I said, \" but the truth is kindest as well as best, and Una has spoken most decidedly in the matter, though she would prefer avoiding an interview with you, and wished me to say good-bye for her. She will always feel as a friend to you, and wish you well, but what you wish is impossible.\" \" Impossible !\" he said, slowly. \" Forgive me, Miss Ferguson, but I feel I have a right to hear Una's —Miss Undine's decision from her own lips. Without this I cannot be satisfied.\" What could I say, but that I would send Una to him, though I thought it would have been better otherwise. I went up-stairs and knocked at her door. There was the saint sound of a sob within, but when Una opened to me, her fair face seemed almost undisturbed. She went down without speaking, and in a short time I saw Captain Maryon walk away with his cavalry swing, and blank disappointment, and I thought, fierce anger on his handsome face. I was standing at the book-room window when he passed near it, and was grieved and even terrified at his look. Could he think Una had given him encouragement ? He had something in his hand, a blue glimmer against his dark morning coat ; and Una had had a blue knot in front of her white dress that morning. Could she be so coquettish as to give him any thread of hope even in her refusal 1 He was the man to twist a cord out of such threads, strong enough to draw her where he would ; unless, unless indeed, there was something within her that would resist; unless her affections, like Rosalind's, \" took the part of a better wrestler than herself,\" and were fixed elsewhere. Well, there was nothing but anger and bitterness in the half-mocking smile on Maryon's lips, and he crushed the ribbon, if ribbon it were, fiercely in his hand, seeming to have a sort of pleasure in defacing the sheeny silk that had risen and fallen on Una's white breast. Yes, it was the same, for before he turned the corner, he loosened his grasp, and suddenly lifted it to his lips, kissing it as if ia compunction, and then I lost sight of him among the pines. A moment after, the door opened, and Una came in. Her face was white, her head drooping, and there was a strange look of mingled fear and resolution about her brow and mouth. She stopped short on seeing me. \" Una,\" I said, \" you have refused him ? Why did you give him anything to take away with him ]\" \" Give him—what could I give hrm 1\" said Una. \" The bow on your dress is gone,\" I said, \" and I saw him pass with something blue in his hand.\"\n",

Una put her hand up, and felt in front of the little cambric frill round her throat, and the colour that had been banished regained its place, and invaded the white neck, brow, and temples. \" It must have fallen off,\" she said, \" and lie has picked it up. Oh, Molly, I am so sorry, he may have thought I meant him to have it, though I said No, as plainly as ever I could.\" \" He took it as No then, not as a No that he might change into Yes in the end?\" \" I tried to make him understand, Molly, that what I felt could never change, but\" \"But what?\" \" He said he would never give up till he saw me the wife of somebody else, that his love was stronger than my indifference. Oh, Molly, I can't tell you all he said, he frightened and vexed me so much. I'm not indifferent to him either, for when he spoke and looked as he did just now, I felt such a shrinking from him, a sort of horror and fear ; I never could love him, never could marry him. He is not a good man; I saw that to-day when he looked at me, trying to make me change my mind.\" As she spoke, there was a slight clatter of horse-hooss, betokening the return of Frank and Elsie, who would seem to have returned prematurely from their early ride. The reason for this was made obvious by Elsie's entrance, with the announcement that it was such a morning for bathing, that it was a sin and a shame for any one to be on dry land, wherefore she had come back early, thinking to find Una all ready to go with her, \" I'll be ready enough by the time you have changed your habit,\" said Una, \" come up stairs.\" The two proceeded up the staircase, and Frank came towards me where I sat. We had gone back to the drawing-room. \" We passed Maryon,\" he said, \" looking, till he took off his hat, as jolly as an undertaker. Has anything happened to him 1 You have jilted him, Molly, you young deceiver, I see it in your face.\" \" I'm sure you don't,\" I replied, \" nobody has jilted him.\" \" Well, he wouldn't look that way for nothing, and he is going off to-day, isn't he 1 La belle cousiue is slaying her thousands. Where is my uncle 1\" \" You next, Frank,\" I said, pretending to start. \" Shall I never see a bachelor of threescore again ?\" \" No, don't be alarmed, I thought he might have done with the paper; you packed us off before I had time to read it this morning. You are as tyrannical as ever, Molly, and just in the old way. Wasn't I always your slave 1\" \" You were always the best of boys,\" I said, \" but though you may find the paper, you won't find Papa.

They came back glowing and bright t O luncheon, and the shadow of the morning seemed gone from Una's face. What a day it was for beauty, that May day. In the evening. Brand Hilary came in alone. There was a change in his manner, hard to define, yet unmistakeable in its presence, as he greeted us all, and he called me Miss Ferguson for the fii-st time for several weeks, for he had quite got into the way of calling me by my Christian name. Una having just recovered from the unusual trouble of that day, was inclined to be rather in high spirits, thinking of course that Brand knew nothing of what had happened in the morning. But I knew better. I was almost certain he either knew or guessed that his friend's errand to our house had not been merely one of leave-taking; what more he thought I could not say. \" Captain Mary on is gone 1\" T said, by way of making conversation, while Una poured out the tea in her own peculiar place, and Frank and Elsie had something particular to say to each other in the bow-window. \" Yes, I've just been seeing him off by the four o'clock train from Kingswood.\" \" You must have had a hot ride.\" \" Yes, that road is like a furnace to-day, and I thought you would have refreshment for the weary, so I sent Tom on with the horses and came in.\" \" You will miss your friend,\" said Una, from her corner. She did not speak quite naturally, neither did Brand, when he said he hoped for another visit from Maryon in September; and after a few more efforts at our old easy style of talk, he rose and said good evening, just as Papa and Mr Haslam appeared passing the window. \" Why, Brand,\" said my father, \" are you off, my boy 1 You will be lonely without your friend; stay to dinner here.\" But Brand said his father would be alone, and went off, leaving a strange feeling of discomfort behind him, as far as I was concerned. After dinner Frank declared he would take Una and Elsie for a row ; the long calm twilight was tempting, and when they were gone to look for a boat, I tired of sitting in the window, for Papa and Mr Haslam had some private affairs to discuss, and I thought I would enjoy the evening in my own way. So I put on my hat and shawl, and strolled out among the pines, as the bells rung for evening service at St Ursula's. Not to go to church, to that church at least; a wider, serener church\n",

No sound was abroad but the far and saint breaking of the waves. \" Sweet hour, that wakes the wish and melts the heart Of those who sail the seas, and of those who linger on the land; of those who are setting forth bright with hope on their life's voyage, and of those who are resting after its troubles. My walk took me past the grave-yard near the sea, where the old Spanish sailor had been buried two months before. No marble monuments were shining there, like those in the statelier burying-ground near the new church, but it was hallowed by the tears of hearts that had broken, over the green mounds where they laid their treasures, wet from the sea, bruised from the cliffs, to rest till the last great day. And I leaned on the low turf-covered wall for a little while, listening to the distant plash of the \" cruel crawling foam\" that could do all this, and yet to-night would hardly stir the fronds of trailing sea-weed on the margin of the tide. And as I listened I heard a sound like a sob, not far from me. It startled me at first, in so lonely a place, but presently, in the fading light, I saw a man's figure sitting on one of the long flat moss-grown slabs of stone, with his face bowed on his hands. There was something familiar about the form or the attitude, and I waited for a moment to see if I could discover who was there alone at that hour. Then I heard Brand Hilary's voice, and remembered that the little grey stone near him bore the name of Mary Evans, and I understood. \" Mary, Mary, \" I heard him say, \" have you forgotten me, darling; do you think I have forgotten you ? Am I faithless, because I let another hope come in between you and me ? I have suffered so long, dear, I thought no joy would ever come again, and now it is taken from me before I had tasted it. Ob, why did not the sea take us both ; am I never to find rest?\" I could hear no more, but the despairing tones went to my heart. I moved to leave the place quietly, (did any one ever do so without creating some unwonted disturbance f), and some fragment of lime and moss, disturbed by the motion of my arm, fell with a sound resembling in the silence a regular crash of masonry. Brand started up, and was beside me before T had time to recover from the shock of the sound myself had made.\n",

It was not to be explained to me that night, for a sound of talking and laughter came breaking the stillness, and three figures were apparent in the dusk, who tui'ned out to be Elsie, Una, and Frank. Their row had been most enjoyable, and it was getting late, and they laughed at Brand Hilary and me, and expressed themselves anxious for the evening meal. And when we got in and the lamps were lighted, and I saw the pleasant little budding tenderness between Elsie and my cousin, and heard Una chattering and joking, my walk by the churchyard seemed like a dream; a dream that haunted me though, for when I fell asleep that night, it was only to see Captain Maryon with that bow of blue ribbon, wearing it like an order,—crushing it in his hand; then came the low sound of the waves, and then Brand Hilary's voice, saying \" Mary, Mary ;\" and then it changed to Lizzie's, who was trying to awake me, and I rose anxious and unrefreshed.

What put it into your head that any such engagement existed ? Tell me, I have a right to know.\" \" I am mistaken, that's enough,\" he said, drawing a long sigh of relief, one of those which \" Perfect Joy, perplexed for utterance, Steals from her sister Sorrow.\" What a change came over his face. The eyes grew radiant with hope and happiness, the bright rare smile came back to his lips, the strong active form straightened itself,—the whole man was different in a moment. I never had seen him look so handsome, such a look would have beautified and sanctified the homeliest, coarsest face, and Brand's was neither coarse nor homely. That glow of joy told his lovestoiy more eloquently than any words could have done, and I knew at once what I had guessed for some time. \" You see, Mary,\" he said, \" I needn't pretend to you that my congratulations would have been very sincere. I have loved your sister Una ever since that first night when I saw her as I wakened up from my ducking, and I shall never have the courage to tell her so.

General Hilary had the courtly manners and thorough kindness of heart which make a perfect host, and when Brand came in and stood beside him, father and son made a goodly picture.

He married again five years after the death of my own mother, who was a Scotchwoman, and his second wife I only saw for a few minutes ; he had very little time to spare before sailing for India, and I was at school. But I remember my step-mother's loveliness ; it made an indelible impression on my childish eyes and heart. Una has her mother's eyes and mouth, but her hair has more of the gold and less of the auburn. I remember how the beautiful young creature, only about twice my own age, warmly embraced her little shy dark step-daughter, and asked me to pray for her as well as for my father, when they were crossing the stormy sea. I never saw her again. One wild night at sea, her baby was born; and she only lived to feel the little helpless hands that seemed tiying to stay the parting spirit, and then went where there is no more sea. My father's giief and horror overcame him, so that his new-born infant had to be cared for by the passengers. She was baptised by a clergyman who happened to be on board ; and her strange name—Undine—was suggested by one of the ladies, who thought it appropriate for one born on the water. She lived and throve, as children sometimes do in spite of circumstances, while others, with the utmost fostering care, pine and die, and, I believe, my father's heart-strings very soon wound themselves tightly round his little white sea-daughter, the only relic left him of his short year of happiness with the lovely girl who had surprised all her friends by accepting the taciturn Scotch surgeon of an Indian regiment for her husband. But what I know is, that, five years after that night, when I was called down to the room where visitors were received, to see my father, and when I saw sitting beside him a child with the radiant eyes I had often dreamt of, and knew she was my little sister Undine, I loved her with all my girl's heart from that time foi-ward. \" Una,\" my father said, after I had kissed him to my satisfaction, \" this is your little new mother. Mary, see what I have brought you from India. A big wax-doll to nurse till I can come home and take care of you both.\" I held out my arms, and the great wistful eyes must have read tenderness in mine; for, in a moment, two little dimpled arms were round my neck, and the sweet baby-mouth was pressed to my own, and I had my Una, my treasure tliat I cannot lose. For surely I know that, if I am taken first and spared the cruel pain of staying where my darling is not, her kiss will be the last upon my lips, before they are sealed for ever; her eyes the last stars that will light up the valley of the shadow of\n",

CHAPTER II. \" This child I for mj Belf will take, She shall be mine, and I will make A lady of my own.\"—IVordsicorth. I CANNOT quite pass over our merry school-time,—mine at least; for Una was so much younger than the youngest of the juniors, that she was, so to speak, in the nursery for several years. But, even at her first appearance among us, she created a great sensation. Well do I remember how, my father being gone, I led Una up to the bedroom, where the girls were employed in dressing for dinner. From a somewhat wild and reckless \" first-classer,\" I had suddenly become a staid and decorous matron, with a sense of responsibility large in proportion to the smallness of my charge. The girls in the west room, to which I belonged, having, contrary to all rules, left their door open, providing like Jenny Rintherout, for the convenience of any one who might wish to come in, saw my face as I cautiously ascended the stairs, before they could at all perceive the tiny creature at my side, and a yell of mirth broke from those irrepressible persons, which school-girls become when left to themselves. \" Here comes the meek Maria, with a face like a sermon on the benefits of afHiction.\" \" Give me your yard-measure, Florry, we'll measure it.\" \" Never mind being short, Molly, sure ye take it out in your features, they'd reach from Dublin to Kingstown.\" \" Has our beloved Mother Superior expelled you for sliding on the baluster V \" Has Monsieur doubled the translation V \" Is the cat dead ?\" \" Have the cockroaches invaded our peaceful couch, eh, Mary V wound up the most mischievous of the five maidens who shared my apartment, \" never mind,— they will not Vt'aken me, Mary ; but what's this V she cried, suddenly changing her tone. \" Oh ! you cherub, come and give me a kiss !\" Then followed a simultaneous rush, overpowering to Una, who hid her face in my dress, but could not hide the universal tumult from the eyes of the first English teacher, who was pacing, like the Lord of Burleigh, along the passage. \" Young ladies,—Miss Fisher, Miss O'Hara, Miss Seymour,—retire to your room, if you jilease, and dress at once. Really, this habit of chattering at doors, rushing up and down stairs, and general noisiness and boyishness, is getting quite beyond me.

The girls contended with me for the honour of combing Una's \" lengths of yellow ringlet,\" and putting her in order generally ; but the time was brief, and the sharp \" now or never\" roar of the dinner-gong was heard before all was done. Jane paused despairingly, with her afternoon frock half over her white shoulders, and grinned a hopeless grin. '• Give my compliments to Madame, tell her how grieved I am not to be able to say gi'.ace over the mutton of the noon-day meal.

It was embarrassing to have to prt sent my sister to Mrs Cl.iyton before the whole array of governesses and pupils, and to hear the mild reproof,—\" And I hope, my dear Mary, you will set Undine a good example of punctuality.\" \" Undine !\" I saw intelligent glances passing between several of the elder girls. The German class were reading La Motte Fouqu^'s beautiful story just then, and I was one of them. I was sorry for it, as I knew the teasing propensities of some of them. I had always spoken of my sister as Una, I call her so still, but the water-sprite was a favourite among the gii'ls, and I knew her namesake would hear enough of her name. I was not mistaken ; Water-witch, Mermaid, Nixie, Lorely, every variety of title that suggested water was heaped upon her; and it was not till they saw that it caused\n",

There was one part of this delightful system of teasing which they clung to for a long time. From the first. Undine showed a strong love for music ; her little voice, sweet and clear as a silver bell, used to be heard all over the house singing snatches of old Hindoo airs, caught up before she could speak, from my father's native servants. When she began to take music lessons, she attached herself strongly to the old music master. He used to give her every extra minute he could possibly spare, and she practised hard for him, and was always angry when the other girls dilated on his ugliness and crossness, in the intervals spent in hunting for theory slates, and wondering which part of the half-acquired \"morceau de salon\" one was most certain to break down in. \" I like Herr Miihlbacli,\" she once slowly said, bringing out each syllable with deliberate clearness, \" he tells me stories about Mozart and (Beethoven was too long a word), and other great men. And if I could play like him, I would do nothing else. I think—(she was alone with Jane and me)—I think the angels stop singing in heaven to listen to such music.\" \" Of course you like him, Water-witch,\" broke in Florry Fisher, who had entered unobserved, \"he is your uncle, your uncle KUhleborn. I always wondered who the old Herr was like, and now I know. Don't go near the well in the garden with him, my dear little merniaid, or he'll dive with you, as sure as fate, and Mary will be left lamenting. Not that I think you would dislike it at all, though we should be sorry to lose you ; but he would bestow you safely in some pleasant cave, where you could warble your own native melodies in peace. . And when I went yachting, as I hope to do next summer, I should look down throfigh the water, and see you seated on a rock, with yoviv dear uncle swimming round, you, bewitched by your melodious strains, like an enchanted seal.\" Even Una's face of anger and indignation could not restrain our mirth at this picture of domestic life below seas ; and our laughter was only bi'oken in ujjon by the sharp voice of Mademoiselle, who sat with us at our music lesson, calling for Mademoiselle Fisher, whereat Florry fled, murmuring, \" I wonder she doesn't translate it into ' Pecheur.' I'm sure she does in her heart, if she is cai)able even of the feeblest j^iun.\" Una was teasing me to tell her all about Kuhleborn, and I was trying to quiet her importunities. She had a keen imagination ; and, if the weird story got hold of her, I felt certain it would do her some harm,—what, I could hardly have defined. There was only one English translation of it in the school, and I persuaded Kate O'Hara, to whom it belonged, to lock it up in her drawer, and begged them all not to tell the story\n",

      "THE ATTEMPT. 55 to Una. They refrained, but the Klihleborn joke was in their eyes too good a one to be let drop, and endless were the ways in which it was brought up. The good, gruff, old Herr went by no other name ; and once, I am ashamed to say, one of the quicksilver spirits of Walton House hid herself in the thick branches of a tree, under which he smoked the pipe of contemplation in the interval after dinner, and began to shower some cold drops (not of modesty) from a watering-can, upon his head. The drops came faster,—he thought a spring shower had begun, when suddenly rising, he saw a gleam of terrestial blue between the leaves, and caught the culprit in the act. \" And that dear old merman, that pet of a Kiilileborn, never said a word about it to Madame,\" recounted Jane to a select audience that night in the short period allowed for undressing. \" I really could not help it; his fuzzy old face looked as if he and his natural element had said farewell for ever. I had the watering-pot—I saw the tree—I knew where he was sure to sit—could an angel have heljjed introducing him to a little of what he must have lived in ? But T watched Mrs Clayton's face all dinner time, and fully expected a summons to her sitting-room to-night. And it never came, blessings on the head of Kuhleborn. May beer descend upon him as fast as rain falls upon less woithy mortals ; may his pipe never go out; may he oh Mademoiselle, je me coucherai tout de suite ! \" This, as the door opened, and a solemn visage appeared. \" Eh bien. Mademoiselle Seymour, toujours en retard,\" and Mademoiselle passed on, while Jane twisted a great coil of yellow hair round her wrist, hastily fastened it up, blew out the candle, and lay down beside me, weary with the apprehensions of the day, for, as she said, \" you might as well be expelled as go on thinking you were sure to be so for a whole afternoon.\" Oh happy, careless, mischievous days, that can never come back! Where is the Mary Ferguson I used to know, who was always ready for any sun that was going, whose laughing and crying were so frequent and so near to each other ? Surely, if the child is mother of the woman, as well as father of the man, my mother has a daughter the antipodes of herself. It is easier to believe that the old, merry, eager, \" riicksichtslos Madchen \" is still rvmning about these old stairs, and schoolrooms, and gardens, than that she has changed into this quiet, sober, domestic woman of nigh thirty years of age, who keeps my father's house. When I was eighteen, and Una eight, my father came home, and I left Mrs Clayton's, and began to study the science of household management. We did not come to St Michael's till about four years before the time at which my story begins. At Mrs Clayton's earnest entreaty, papa let Una remain at Hamp-\n",

He himself wandered about, now coming to Kedmains to see me, now taking me to Edinburgh to keep house for him, now to London to see Una. The great joy of my life came to me, as the summer comes to the flowers, and I walked the world wrapped in a mantle of dreams too dear to last, till one autumn day I woke, to tind that I had spent in a few months the happiness that should have lasted a life-time, and that my lover liad left me. Few of my friends knew of it, and Una does not know it now. The fii'st time I went to Hampstead after that day, she stroked my white cheeks and asked if I were well, and I told her I had been ill, that was all. \" All life needs for life is possible to will,\" and all that was needful wakened up again in me ; and I lived for her and for my father. My aunt's boisterous \" handful of children \" were a great help to me, and also the daily efibrts I made to make myself a good housekeeper. I can't go into a house where the boys are all at home, and hear hammering and shouting, and the usual variety of necessary noises, without a strange pain at my heart, as it goes back to that noisy Scotch home, where the gates of Eden shut upon me, and I went out among the thorns and thistles with weary feet^ changed from a girl into a woman. When Una was about to leave school, my father suddenly arrived at Redmains, and told me his plans. He had fixed u])on St Michael's as a convenient place of residence ; his old Indian friend. General Hilary, would let him a house there; in short everything was fixed, how soon could I be ready? \" Just come in to dinner, James,\" interposed my aunt, \"and never mind Mary till afterwards.\" So in he went, and I adjoui'ned after dinner to the nursery, where a wild wailing had already begun among the young and tender of Aunt Laurie's flock. Willie, Jamie, Harry, Eonald, Geordie, joined in a chorus of lamentation over Cousin Mary's departure, a rumour of which had reached the regions above, through the agency of a malicious nursemaid. I was sitting on the floor among them, submitting to be \" pu'd at \" like Tibby Fowler of wealthy memory, while they proved, to the satisfaction of all disputants, that six bodies could occupy the same space at the same time, or nearly so, for we were heaped together in an undistinguishable mass of cousinly grief and mournful affection, when my aunt came in. \" Now boys, let Cousin Mary alone, she has enough to do. My dear Molly,\" she said, as we went down stairs, \" what I'll do without you I can't think, but your father wants you to go with him to-morrow.\" \" So soon ! \" and I said nothing more, for my thoughts hurried to one part of the garden that must be taken leave of. /\n",

      "THE ATTEMPT. 57 I said goodnight early, and gained time for packing. Everything was arranged, and next morning I awoke just as \" the casement slowly grew a gliaimering square.\" Rain had fallen in the night, and all was still. I rose and dressed, knelt and prayed,—-prayed that the bitterness of my life might be changed to sweetness in the life to come,—and then wrapped a shawl round me, and went out,—out through the wet walks, till I came to the seat under the rowan-tree near the little loch, and there I sat down. Tears would not come there, in the chill early day ; the time had been when I cried till the old boards were as wet with my tears as they were with the rain, but that time was past. I only sat and thought of what was gone, and then I kissed the senseless wood, and the bark of the trysting tree, and gathered a bunch of coral berries and a few primrose leaves, aud came back to the house. And that day, though poor Redmains put on all its autumn finery to tempt us to stay, and the sun shone royally out upon bracken and rock and heather, and the \"rampageous\" cousinhood held on to Cousin Mary with the energy of despair, till they extracted from her a general promise, as vaguely affectionate as Willie's in the old song,— \" Oh lasses, bide till I come back, ; ; And faith I'll wed ye a',\" we went away. We were to pick up Una in London, and it was hard work for her to part from Mrs Clayton and her schoolfellows, who adored her in true school-girl fashion.

I SHALL never forget the day we came to St Michael's. We reached it late in the evening, driving some six miles from the last station. The hrst whiff of salt seabreeze sent a sort of recognising shiver of delight through Una's whole body. I remember, as I looked at her,^sitting with her back to the horses in the disreputable old \" shay,\" her clustering love-locks thrown off her face, and the soft lassitude of a hot day's journey still upon her,—how her great eyes suddenly brightened, and a glow came over her cheeks, and each little delicate nostril expanded at the scent of the sea, when it stole over her senses again. \" Papa, Molly, do you feel if?\" she cried, \"oh, bless the sea, I can feel the smell of it again. Let me out, I'll walk the rest of the way. There's going to be the loveliest moon that ever was, and it will shine upon the sea, and I shall look at it.\" \" Sit still, child,\" broke in papa, countermanding the order to the Jehu, who was drawing up his by no means fiery steeds; \" are you cracked, to think of walking three miles as a finish to to-day's exertions V Una \" fidgeted,\" to revert to a Hampstead figure of speech. I felt her little boots dancing upon mine; she wriggled herself further into the corner of the carriage, and we watched the moon rise, golden and glorious, over a black belt of pines to the left. Should we never get a glimpse of the wide water where she was born ? Yes, there it was. The pines swept away like a dark curtain, and suddenly revealed the sea ; and Una started up in an ecstasy, and stretched out her hands as a child might to its mother. There it lay, glittering in the moonlight, and there, on the other side of the bay, flickered the lights of St Michael's. \" Oh, how glad I am to come to this place. I shall always like it, because we saw it first in this way,\" said Una, subsiding. \" Darling Molly, Mary mother, you're done out to-night, and of course you don't appreciate the effects, but to K\n",

Say what you like. When I find this marine paradise dull, I'll tell you so. Here we are at last, and there's old Lizzie to meet us !\" Old Lizzie, be it known, was one of those fast-vanishing treasures of servants who are still found in the remote parts of these islands, far from register offices, amorous policemen, and the other disturbing influences which make the domestics of to-day such a fluctuating body. Thirty years had she served us and ours, with service worth the name ; faithfulness no money could hire, steadfast affection that sought no change and knew no check. She had come as servant to my mother when both were young, gone with her to her married home, nursed me with vigilant care, and stayed behind when I went to school, in accordance with my mother's last charge, to take care of the master. In one capacity or another, she had been with some of us ever since, and now stood waiting to welcome us at the gate of our new abode,—the first home, properly so called, that we had all known. Quiet, respectful, somewhat imperious at times, but always so affectionately careful, so earnestly conscientious, truly Elizabeth M'Pherson (such was her full title) deserved a memorial oak-tree, green and brave as that which stretched its arms over Deborah's grave in the land of her exile. A sensible, shrewd Scotch face, not a plain full face yet, though she numbers fifty years ; grey hair over a broad forehead, large grey eyes, pawky and keen, and rather wide mouth and a chin denoting decision, as her smile shows benevolence,— such is she, cui-tseying in her decent garb of black. \" Ye're welcome, sir. Ay, Miss Una, ye've no come far eneugh this day, that's weel seen.\" This as Una, hastily shaking hands with her, made a rush towards the house, which showed whitely in the moonlight, and invited immediate inspection. \" I've got a lass for housemaid, Miss Mary, ma'am, and if ye like her nae better than I do, ye'll no set much store by her.

The tap of croquet mallets began to be heard, and St Michael's was popular and populous. Such was the state of things when Una had attained her twentieth year, and become the girl I have described. Well, we sat beside each other, T in a low arm-chair, and Una on the fernstrewed floor of the drawing-room,—her white arm, in its muslin sleeve, on my kneej her glorious head shining out against the darkness of the rest of the room. Chignons are vulgar and ugly in themselves, some people say, but Una's was not. Her hair was all rippled back, and was lost in the mass of gold behind ; it hardly looked more beautiful as it waved below her waist when she came in from bathing. She was looking into the fire, and talking dreamily, as she often did, when alone with me in our quiet fire-light time after dinner. \" Mary,\" she said, and then came a pause. \" Well, what darling ?\" said I. \" Mary, I read Undine before I left Hampstead.\" \" Is that alii\" said I, with a sigh of relief; for to tell you, 0 reader, the truth, a family of Glynnes had settled at St Michael's a year before, and the son had for some time been paying marked attentions to Una,—therefore I trembled lest he should that very day have ' put it to the touch,' as we had been lunching there. \" Is that all 1 You wicked child, when I took such pains to keep it from you.\" \" They were never done teazing me aboiit Kiihleborn and Hildebrand, and waterwitches and mermaids,\" she said, \" and so I took possession of a copy old Herr Hartmann left about, and read it through, in the original, Molly.

There is one lovely little landscape,—No. 456, \" The Mountaia Tarn,\" by Sir George Harvey, that is also remarkable for the sweet poetry of its composition. It is a very rural and pastoral' scene, with browsing sheep, pleasant green hills, a tiny lake, and summer sky. The charming stillness of the scene steals upon one's senses like the grateful feeling of the soft summer air. We advise our readers to examine for themselves \" The Pass of the Cattle,\" by John Smart No. 816, Sculpture Eoom,— a beautiful j^icture, tnithful and powerful, with some finely painted cattle in the foreground. No. 706, \" Twilight on the Moor,\" by James Cassie. How admirably is the feeling of weariness given in the slow moving horses up the darkening road. The same artist has a sweet summer moonlight scene,—No. 551. No. 429, \"Inistrynich,\" by Arthur Perigal, is a charming, crispy landscape, beautifully painted; unfortunately, however, devoid of all the softening effects of atmosphere : the tree in the foreground is a perfect study of foliage. We must not omit to mention No. 401, \" Evening,\" by Joseph Farquharson. The old subject,—a long picturesque path between two walls of Scotch sirs, the setting sun gilding the tops of the trees and radiating the perspective. J. C. Wintour has several very efifective pictures, whose colouring seems to date from the middle ages. In our wanderings up and down, we have omitted to mention a number of very charming things ; but, as we have to take a rapid glance, both at the genre pictures and the water-colours, we are forced unwillingly to leave the landscapes. No. 486, \"The Sleep of Duncan,\" by Daniel Maclise. This picture portrays a scene of which the world never tires. Lady Macbeth is a name that never palls upon the ear ; and the arch-sjiirit of this tragedy is here depicted, but not exactly as the world loves to imagine her. We do not think Mr Maclise's conception quite realises the idea formed of the dread murderess in the popular imagination,—she who never faltered in her fell purpose, and yet who had all a woman's nature. The figure of the sleeping king is very fine. Shakespeare's own words,—\" There's such divinity doth hedge a king,\" are quite applicable to the sleeping monarch, who looks every inch a king. The guards are well disposed, as are also the accessories, although somewhat out of harmony with the times in which this dire tragedy is supposed to have taken place.

Indeed, it was needless; Una might have shown him her heart's inmost depth, and his own image would have looked back at him from out of it. I felt sure of that. For her, when he was gone, \" All men else went with him.\" And yet I could not forget the sudden disagreement so suddenly made up, and wondered if all would pass off smoothly in the end. The marriage had at length been fixed for the end of October, and, in the meantime, the day of the ball was drawing nigh. Mrs Sandyside was in full tide of preparations, so that Brand made excuses to come continually, and without ceasing, to Laurence Lodge, because we were not going to have a ball. \" It's no use, Mary,\" he said, \" a fellow must sit down somewhere. And old Grace has bagged all the chairs at home, what she has done with them she best knows. We bivouac among the ruins of our home. My father was once used to a military life, but I never was. A swamp 's a swamp, and in the backwoods one can sit anywhere, and sleep anyho Av, but in a Christian country, one expects something like a chair, not to say a bed. But we shall soon be like David Copperfield's waiter, who lived on broken victuals and slept on the coals. ' Here the waiter burst into tears.' My guest! Oh, most sweet hostess, my guest is gone, his leave is up, his pipe is out, the partridges at Wemley Gorse are safe from his unerring breechloader, and they ar'nt in very great danger from mine. I can't be bothered blazing away at them.\" . And he sat down beside Una and pulled away her work, thereby eliciting the remark that if she had known what would ensue when Captain Maryon's leave was up, she would have written to the Colonel to ask for an extension of it. \" He is'nt gone so very far after all,\" said Brand, \"not quite beyond recall. Tliey are all awfully bored at Wemborough, it seems. Some of them have taken to morning service in the Minster, and there is a convent of old nuns in the High Street, so, for a lark, Maryon told the junior cornet, Tresham, that there was a lovely girl among them who had been got in by some trick, and was pining for a deliverer; she was to take the black veil in a few weeks, and meantime, was allowed to walk, closely veiled, just at dusk, in one part of the convent garden. So ever since he (Tresham, I mean) has been hanging on by his eyelids about that time in the eve, to the wall of the garden, where it is just above the river, on the look-out for his charming novice. Unluckily, he has never seen her yet; but one evening Maryon says, he came in dripping wet, and told one of his friends, in strict confidence, that he had seen a nun's figure coming along, ' no end of a good figure,' as far as he could\n",

I could not live without you. The sea has been good to vis too. Do you remember ]\" Una only smiled, a smile that vanished quickly as the more perfect memory of that night returned, then came archly back to the ever-changing lips. \"Yes, I remember, you poor flotsom and jetsom, how little I thought whom I was receiving beneath our humble roof! Haven't those amiable wreckers, who used to knock shipwrecked mariners on the head, a proverb about the man whom you have saved from drowning 1\" \" Being sure to do you an injury,\" said Brand. \" Yes, sooner or later.\" \" So to prevent mistakes they did him an injury at once,\" said Una. \" But I needn't be afraid of you, I didn't save you.\" \" You did your best, but it was Maryon. He is a plucky fellow, never stuck at anything when we were boys. Una, I have something to tell you. Do you know I once thought you were engaged to Maryon 1\" \" Who told you so 1\" said Una, quickly. \" Nobody.\" \" Then what put it into your head 1\" \" Well, it would have taken a bat not to see we were both after the same thing.\" \" Thing, indeed !\" from pouting Una. \" The same queen, the same darling, the same water-witch ; but when Maryon went to Laurence Lodge to say good-bye, I guessed what he was up to, and thinking. as I did, that we were much the same to you, how was I to know what your answer would be ? So I waited at home till he came back, and I would have defied twenty detectives to find out from his face whether it had been yes or no. I went with him to see him off, without saying a word about it; but just as we were shaking hands I couldn't stand it any longer, and I said, trying to speak as if I didn't care for the answer, \" No chance for a civilian at Laurence Lodge now, I suppose 1\" and I laughed like a hyena ; it was a hideously unsuccessful piece of humbug. Maryon said nothing, but just lifted his left hand lazily to his breast pocket,—we were alone in the railway carriage,—and pulled out an end of blue ribbon, and then I thought it was all lip with me. I had seen you with that on the day before.\" \" It was a lie,\" said Una, \"as much a falsehood as if he had spoken it. I must\n",

Perhaps, though, he thought I let it fall on purpose.\" \"I know what he wished me to think, at anyrate,\" said Brand. \"It shows the sort of fellow he is, darling. All's fair in love, they say, but I don't think that was. Of course, I have never said a word about it to him. Mary undeceived me.\" \" Let us go home,\" said Una, rising and taking one more look over the wan water; \" I want to get back to Molly.\" So the two re-appeared; and in a week the 20th came, and about nine in the evening Una and I were ready, and the carriage took us up to the Hall: the entrance was lighted up, and here and there among the trees lamps glistened. I had never seen Una look lovelier than she did that night; her white ball-dress and the pearl ornaments papa had given her, made her look like a fairy queen, and when we came into the drawing-room, I heard a little murmur of questions. Alost of the guests were already assembled, and the dancing had begun. A dismal introductory quadrille was in progress, in the midst of which I beheld Brand, leading a measure with the eldest Miss Screwbury. I thought also I noticed a slight stamp of his foot, which had nothing to say to the music, when he caught sight of Una. That he was doing his duty was obvious, and yet when Una saw him, her cheeks flushed and then grew a little paler than before. The General greeted us as we came in, and just after we had taken our seats, there was a mighty tramping in tlie hall, up the stairs, and the officers of the 11th came in, blazing in full uniform, and were shaken hands with, and bowed to, and then grouped themselves aftejthe manner of men, looking with watchful eyes towards the blue, pink, cerise, and white masses of drapery that adorned the walls of the room. Among them I saw one whom I fixed upon as the much-deluded Tresham, with bright curly hair glittering in the gleam of the wax-lights, honest grey English eyes, and a bloom on the fair boyish cheeks that many a girl in the room might have envied. Near him stood Maryon, and I wished, with a nervous eagerness, that the quadrille would finish before he had remarked our presence. But it had only just begun, apparently ; couples advanced and retreated, shy young men mistook the figure, and were left alone, prancing nervously in the midst, till shoved into their places by well-meaning but impatient friends; one or two of the pairs ignored the music and the figure altogether, and remained quietly chatting in the background. Rose Glynne, a mass of floating white frills, over-canopied by a pink silk tunic, came swimming like \"a western cloud\" towards us from the corner where she had been sitting, and laid a plump little kidgloved hand in mine.\n",

      "94 THE ATTEMPT. \" You here, Molly ! Why, Vi might have come if she had known. Are you only acting as chaperone to the bride 1 How charming the rooms look and the Hall!'' She insinuated herself between Una and me, and the quadrille music went thumpinoand banging on. I began to ask Rose about Violet. \" We have to thank you, Molly, that she isn't in her cell at Wemborough now ; but she has taken another turn, and is going to be an hospital nurse, and I'm afraid she won't be put off that by anything you can say.\" I was very much startled, but it was a better thought than her former one, and I felt I dare hardly try to reason her out of it. \" She wouldn't come here to-night, of course,\" I said; and the words were hardly spoken when I heard Captain Maryon's voice bidding us good evening. He had brought Mr Tresham with him, and introduced him to Rose, and stood speaking to me for a little, while the quadrille was drawing to a close. I saw Brand leading his partner to her seat, and I knew where he would turn next, of course; but just then some one I knew came up to speak to me, a group of people surged past us, and in a moment more I saw Captain Maryon and Una engaged in conversation. The usual comparison of programmes, showing a list of dances with blanks opposite them, the usual chat about the look of the rooms and the people, and then Brand came up. He shook hands with us, and took j^ossession of Una's card, writing down his name for the next dance; and Una rose and took his arm, not without a slight blush, and the two went off among the other dancers. Captain Maryon looked slightly discomfited, and I thought I heard the word \" Vasliti\" muttered as he went to look for a partner. Then the valse began, sweet sad notes to set people swinging and twirling, like dragon flies on a summer pool, and Tresham and Rose whirled past me to the time, and then Brand and Una. How beautiful she looked when they paused for a little, her cheek a shade rosier han usual, her eyes shining with excitement, for a ball was by no means an every-day matter with Una, and the lights, the flowers, the music, and the people had all their effect upon her. Every now and then, when Brand's eyes were somewhere else for a moment, hers would be lifted and fixed on his face with a fond, faithful look of honest love and admiration, foi-, without depreciating anybody else. Brand might fairly be called the handsomest man in the room. Captain Maryon's figure was equally good; but I have already told you, O i-eader, why I preferred Brand's face to his, in spite of its wellcut features and haunting eyes. They were doing their best now to captivate a pretty little girl of seventeen, the niece of Mr Brookes, who was on a visit to St jMichael's. Round and round went tarletaue, muslin, silk, tulle, and gaze de Cham_\n",

Brand brought Una back to me, having to dance the next quadrille with an elderly dowager who had come from afar, and who did, by no means, consider herself, like old Montague, to have past her dancing days. And soon after Captain Maryon came up again, this time asking if Una would like some refreshment; and I watched them depart together with tlie old uneasy feeling in my mind. And though my ears could no moi-e hear through two walls than Sam Weller's eyes could see through a deal door, I know what passed between them; Una told me afterwards. They sat together in the room where ices, Moselle cup, and other dainties were arranged for the guests. It was on the same floor as the drawing-room, an old-fashioned room full of little recesses and corners, now turned into little bowers for the nonce, with greenery and hothouse plants. In one of these was a tempting looking sofa, and here Captain Maryon deposited Una j and having cast anchor beside her, began by congratulating her on her engagement. \" I really hadn't a chance to do it before, Miss Undine ; but of course you know how sincerely I wish your happiness, even though ,\" and here he stopped. \" Thank you,\" said Una, not exactly knowing what next to say, but going on with \" I am sure you do.\" \" Hilary deserves you, and I can say no more for him,\" Louis Maryon continued. \" He is the luckiest fellow under the sun, and I don't grudge him his good fortune. And yet, to-night, this evening will be so short, and who knows when we may meet again 1 Is it strictly forbidden that you should dance with anyone but Mr Hilary 1\" Una hesitated, ashamed in her foolish pride to acknowledge that Brand had expressed any wish in the matter ; and Captain Maryon interpreted her silence. \" Ah well, I see it is. Then will you talk to me a little, give me one night, one hour to remember out of the years 1\" \" You are mistaken, Captain Maryon,\" said Una. \" I do not wish to dance much to-night, otherwise, of course, I could do so as much as I liked. And I can talk to you, of course, but it is better not to go back upon anything that can only give pain to us both. There are plenty of other subjects.\" Maryon laughed, not a very pleasant laugh to hear. \" Oh yes, lots of other subjects, and lots of other opportunities to talk them over in. If a man\n",

You will think I have forgotten myself, among other trifles, if I go on, Miss Undine. You are Mr Hilary's promised wife, and I am his friend. And I have no right to speak of what might have been, any more than you have inclination to listen. Yet I saved Brand Hilary's life. I saved your lover for you. Do you owe me nothing?\" It was the first time he had ever referred to the brave venture on that stormy night, and Una felt almost alarmed, startled, and shaken by the meaning in his voice and the passion in his face. \" I owe you a great deal, Captain Maryon,\" she said. \" I shall never forget how you put your life in danger for his, even though you did not know whom you were saving. I owe you thanks and gratitude, and I give them with all my heart.'' \" And a generous fellow would ask for nothing more. Brand would have done as much for me if he had had the chance. But I 'm not generous, Miss Undine— neither generous nor plucky, I 'm beginning to think. My heart is as selfish and as hungry and as wild as the sea that night, when I look at you and think that I never can win you, the only woman I ever loved. Forgive me, and have pity on me. Think for one minute of that poor wretch I was speaking of, condemned to death ; do you think you would grudge him any token he asked for before he died, something for his hand to hold underground when he was dead ? It would do you no harm to think he had that last comfort.\" \" I don't know what you mean. Captain Maryon,\" said Una. \" If I could do you a service I would, as you know, but it is not right to talk to me in this way.\" \" Are you afraid it would make Mr Hilary angiy if he knew 1\" said Louis Maryon, mockingly. \" Don't be alarmed.

Somehow, I can't feel that you are so comjjletely the property of the future owner of this desirable family mansion, as much his as the plate, and the wine, and the other concomitants of greatness, so much his, that you are no longer at your own disposal, and can't grant a favour.\" \" What is the fiivour. Captain Maryon 1\" said Una, her cheeks flushing at the careless sarcasm of his tone, which was not surprising, as it was assumed for the express purpose of provoking her. \" Only a dance,\" he said. \" Just once to have danced with you would be something to remember, and you said just now you could dance if you liked. Let me see if that was a boast or not. There 's another waltz beginning.\" Una hesitated. His taunt had stirred up all her spirit of opposition to Brand's wishes, and had Brand himself been there to repeat them by look or word, it would at once have broken out; but his absence was in his favour. \" I have a condition to make, Captain Maryon,\" she said. \" You have something of mine which you never should have had, and never were intended to take. I cannot comprehend why you took it; but if you joromise to give it me back immediately, I may dance one dance with you.\" \" Not otherwise % You are tyrannical, Miss Undine. Trust a woman for using all the power she can get into her hands, to say nothing of abusing it.\" \" It is nothing to me,\" said Una, hastily, \" and I think I had better not dance much to-night. Mary is by herself, too; would you mind taking me back into the other room, Captain Maryon ?\" \" I should mind it veiy much just at present, till this little question is settled,\" he replied. \" It is nothing to you, I daresay, but it is a gi-eat deal to me.\" Una hesitated, he might think she attached great importance to the concession if she refused it, and yet if she granted his request, might it not do harm % The waltz music went tinkling on, most of the resting coiiples in the room of refreshments, had gone off to renew their exertions; the veiy spirit of the music seemed to pass into Una's feet, and they quivered to its spell; it seemed as though her little high-heeled satin slippers would dance away with her, like the red shoes in Hans Andersen's weird story. And forgetting everything else in the sudden and strong desire she felt to join the dancers, she said, \" Very well, I will dance this dance with you, only one, remember,\" and Maryon sprang up and offered her his arm, with some soft Spanish exclamation of half-suppressed delight and triumph, such as broke from him now and then, trembling on his lips.\n",

      "THE ATTEMPT. 115 In a few minutes more they had caught the time, and were moving swiftly and gracefully among the throng of dancers. Now, while the above conversation was going on, a headache, which had been lying in wait for me all day, had suddenly seized me, and the noise and the lights increased it to an almost unbearable pitch. I looked round for Una, but she was beyond my ken, and seeing my father standing near the door, I made my way to him and committed her to his care, asking him to bring her home in reasonable time, and apologizing to the General, who was talking to my father, for my hasty and enforced retreat. For when I walked across the room, a sort of dizziness, caused by excessive pain, forewarned me of the impossibility of staying any longer, if T wished to avoid fainting. The General made offers of Mrs Sandyside's aid, the quietness of her room, etc., but well I knew that worthy soul would have little peace in room or mind that night, and I sat in the comparative coolness of the entrance-hall till the carriage appeared, wishing I had left Una with Brand, instead of our military friend, and feeling troubled and uneasy, though the pain T was enduring was such as almost to prevent me from thinking. It abated in the quiet darkness of the carriage, and I was better when I reached Lawrence Lodge, and found the ever-ready Lizzie to sympathize and make much of me. I was installed on the sofa in the drawing-room at last, determined to sit up till Una came home; and while I am there, my story must go back to the Hall. While Una was passing into the dancing-room on Captain Maryon's arm, she could not help looking round for Brand, half wistfully, half mischievously, but whether luckily or unluckily, she saw nothing of him till after she had circled round the room several times and stopped to rest. Maryon was bending over her, talking in the low tone he was fond of using, and fanning her assiduously, when, by a sudden instinct she lifted her eyes and met Brand's, with an expression in them she had never seen before. He was standing against the wall opposite the place where they had paused, his whole face intent upon Una, so much so that he hardly seemed to notice her partner, and Una was frightened, finally provoked, by his look. Had her own conscience been clear, it would have brought her to his side at once, to find out its cause, but she was conscious of having provoked the sit of jealous anger which was locking Brand's lips together, and making his hazel eyes blaze like an angry lion's, and she resolved to go her ov/n way, in spite of such glances. \"Are you ready?\" said Maryon, and without more delay Una set off with him again, nov did they stop till the last notes of the waltz were sobbing themselves out on the warm perfumed air of the crowded room.\n",

      "116 THE ATTEMPT. \" How sad those tunes are,\" she said, as they crossed the floor to find a seat; \" that last one was like a dii-ge.\" \" It was like a dirge to you, and it was a dirge to me,\" said Louis Maryon, \" 'the last, the last, the last,' was in every note of it, and now it is done.\" He found a place for Una next Mrs Glynne, then bowed and was lost among a group of brother-ofiicers, while she was left to meditate on what she had done. Not a word had he said of fulfilling her condition, she had gained nothing by granting his request, except a pleasant dance with a good partner, and what might she not have lost 1 Surely not Brand's love, or the confidence that is the \" roof and crown \" of love ? Where could Brand be ?—nothing was to be seen of him. Some one came up to be introduced by the General. Una was tired, could not dance. Would she come and get some refreshment? Oh yes; and hastily rising, she passed on into the cooler atmosphere, outside the dancing-room. Still Brand was nowhere. Mrs Glynne had told her of my disappearance, when she had sought me after that unlucky valse, and she replied almost at random to Mr Leslie's speeches; so that the said young barrister, who was staying for a few days at the Hall, knew not what to make of her, and set her \" distraction \" down to the efiect of approaching matrimony. Meanwhile, where was Brand 1 No one can be more competent to give information on that point than myself, for Brand was sitting on one of the ai'm-chairs at Lawrence Lodge, his usual chair, which I had some diificulty in persuading him to t;ike, looking hurt, and angry, and inconsolable. Not very long after I was settled on the sofa, I had heard quick impatient steps on the gravel, and Brand marched in. I was thunder-struck. \" My dear Brand, is anything the matter 1 What is wrong 1\" I cried, starting up. \" I )jeg your pardon, Mary,\" he said, \" I'm civil, disturbing you, when you had come home for quiet, but the fact is, I'm otf on a journey, and come to say goodbj^e.\" \" What are you thinking of?—a journey, at this time of night. Brand, tell me what has happened.\" \" Nothing has happened, but what I might have foreseen,\" he said, standing against the mantelpiece, and biting his lips. \" Una has been trifling with me, and with Maryon too, I fancy, and I was fool enough to think her incapable of it. I might have known,—all women are alike, they say, and I've made experiments enough for one. Did I tell you Markham had bought a yacht, and is going across the Atlantic? Last week lie asked me to join him, and I'll do it now, I lauglied at him then, you know. So dear Mary, I'm ofl'; Markham is getting all ready at , and is going to start directly.\"\n",

      "THE ATTEMPT. 117 \" Brand, are jou going to break Una's heart for a mere fancy?\" I said. \" Sit down and listen to reason.\" \" I'd rather stand ; I'm in a hurry, Mary.\" \" Yes, you're in a hvirry ; of coui-se, when a man is going to be foolish, and heartless, and cruel, the quicker he goes on the better. Wait, sit down. Brand. I wont say goodbye to you, as you seem to wish, while you stand there.\" \" Anything to please you,\" and he flung himself into a chair. There was one l^oint gained. I now observed for the first time that he had dressed himself in rather a rough-looking coat, suggestive of salt water, instead of the accurate sables in which he had graced the ball, which gave an air of vraisemblance to his project of yachting. Markham was a young American he had known in New York, who had only recently come to England, and now wished to make a trip back again. \" Now let us talk like reasonable beings. What has Una done ?\" \" Well, I could see nothing of her for a good while, and when 1 did see her at last, she was waltzing with Maryon. She knew I was looking at her, though she pretended to take no notice. You need tell me she was not flirting, Mary, and with the very man I wished her to avoid.\" Need I say how I combated his arguments, and tried to bring him round, all the time knowing that one look from Una would be more powerful than all I could say, but little hoping for the auxiliary I obtained very shortly. I glanced towards the window in a pause, while Brand was staring at the floor, sotting himself down for the most injured lover that had ever been since lovers were, and I gave a start, and suppressed a scream, for there was Una's face, looking white and frightened, yet with a half-penitent, half-comical twinkle in the soft eyes; it was as quickl}'withdrawn, and I heard, with love's sharp ears, the quick light footsteps at the door. I did not stop to wonder why, how, or when she left the Hall > but I rose and went out, leaving Brand to wonder, and just took hold of Una, for Una it was, and not her wraith, brought her into the drawing-room, in spite of a sort of saint struggle on her part, said, \" Here is Una, come to beg your pardon, and be good for the future,\" and went upstairs. How they settled it between them, those two foolish young people, history says not, but when I came down to tell Brand he might just return to his guests, and leave us in peace, I found them both on the most amicable, not to say aflectionate terms,—Una having enjoyed a good cry, positively her last, ] think, till the day when she changed her name to Una Hilary, and Brand having quite got over his sit of indignation.

There was one little packet with a foreign post-mark, addressed in a hand more familiar to me than to Una. \"Violet Glynne,\" I said, \"what is she doing abroad. Ah yes, she is one of the Red Cross sisterhood, and has gone to nurse the wounded.\" Something about the look of the letter made me cany it off to read it in the library. First came out something wrapped in paper, with \" for Mrs Hilary,\" w Titten outside; then Violet's letter, strangly interesting, coming as it did from the black battle-cloud on the Rhine. \" Dearest Mary,\" it ran, \" I came here to help, with the other nurses. I feel as if I had had a presentiment, or I should not have insisted so on coming. I had never shirked the work at the hospital, and they said they could trust me. It is not many days, I cannot coimt them, since we came to Sedan, and one night I was sent for to nurse a wounded man. He was lying in a sort of shed, and there was hardly any light, but I saw that death was on him, and I knew he was Louis Maryon. I never thought how he came there, though I have heard since he volunteered into a Prassian I'egiment,—I only saw him and knew he was dying. You can feel for me, Molly. I had no time to feel then. I bound ujj his wound, and did all I could for him, and suddenly he seemed to recognize me. \" ' Violet, Violet Glynne,' he said, ' what are you doing here 1' \" ' I am at my work,' I said, ' nursing those who want me.' \" ' You are good to me,' he said, ' I am glad to have an English face near me, for I have a message, and you need not tell me it's all over with me, I knew it when I fell. Send this to Mary Ferguson; she knows who it belonged to ;' and he drew what I send you out of his breast. ' She will see then I have never forgotten her,' he said, but so low that I could hardly hear it. Mary, I was beside him there alone, you know what he is to me, and he was dying, and thinking of no one but Una. I took the ribbon from him, and promised to send it to you, and then I read to him, bvit he did not seem able to listen. ' It's all very dark,' he said, ' Una, Una,' and then I saw he had no more need of me, Mary. I have been working hard day and night, but now there is a rest, and I have found time to write. Give this to Una, or keep it, whichever you think best,—I have fulfilled my trust. He died as a brave man should die.

The Works of George Berkeley, D.D., formerly Bishop of Cloyne: Including many of his \"Writings hitherto unjjublished. With Prefaces, Annotations, his Life and Letters, and an Account of his Philosophy. By ALEXANDER CAMPBELL FRASER, M.A., Professor of Logic and Metaphysics in the University of Edinburgh. In 4 volumes. Oxford, at the Clarendon Press. The thanks, not only of the philosophical world, but of all for whom true nobility has charms, are due to the painstaking research and appreciative enthusiasm which have laid before the public, in a form far surpassing in completeness and interest any previous attempt of the kind, the record of the life and work of Bishop Berkeley of Cloyne. Neither the character of such a man, marked as it was no less by warm affections, pure faith, unbounded charity, and the most splendid philanthrophy, than by mental gifts of the highest rank, nor his pious and beautiful system of philosojihy—the natural outcome of such a mind,—should be allowed to pass lightly out of memory. All must, therefore, welcome the appearance, in these four volumes, of a guarantee for the perpetuation of both the one and the other. No formal criticism of the merits of this new edition of Berkeley's Works is attempted here. We only at present call attention to the gi-eat care which has been taken to elucidate and supplement the text by notes, dissertations, and prefaces, and the fact that several miscellaneous treatises, now published for the first time, form part of the contents of these interesting volumes.\n",

The building contains also a collection of curiosities, including divers relics of Peter the Great of Eussia, and our own William and Mary; but the ruling interest is attached to the pictures, first and foremost of which stands Paul Potter's world-renowned \" Bull.\" It is, for power and breadth of conception and execution, an extraordinaiy work of art, while its life-like vigour is perfectly startling in effect, the strong, downright animal aspect of the bull being brought out in grand relief against the quietly contemplative expressions of the cow and \" Gentle Shepherd.\" Eembrandt's well-known representation of a \"Professor's Anatomical Lecture,\" strikes the mind powerfully with its truthful expression and wonderful accuracy of detail; but a more pleasing impression is produced by a \" Cottage Interior \" of Gerard Dow, painted with all the truth and naivete of the Pre-Kaphaelite School, without its occasional bold, harrowing effects. My attention was particularly attracted by two shadow pictures, in one of which the light of a candle is thrown athwart a jewelled ornament which a lady is putting in her ear, and in the other, a stream of sunlight, slanting through pillared arches in the back-ground, falls full upon the figures of a lady and her dog in front; also two female heads, both Magdalens, the first, dark in complexion and suffering in expression; the other, with fair hair shining round an exquisitely beautiful and touching face. Hurrying thi-ough this little temple of painting, we started in a large landau, thrice seated across, and open at the sides, for the Palace in the Wood, summer residence of the Queen of Holland, which is more accessible from the haunts of men than the fairy-tale associations of its name might lead us to supjwse. Darkened by no bosky glades to hide a Robin Hood or wandered babes, nor tangled thickets to bewilder a fairy prince, the approach leads through a long succession of avenues of thinly planted trees, mostly elms, through whose early spring verdure, the sunbeams glanced down with a kindlier greeting than that of the east wind which pursued us during the whole course of our drive with relentless rigour. The abode of royalty is little more than a plain country house, fitted up in a truly airy and summery style, lacking any display of that regal magnificence essential to our insular ideas of court surroundings ; her Majesty's dining-room and boudoir being furnished in the extreme of simplicity,—the latter decked out in white and green and gilt, the chairs cane-bottomed, covered with cushions, and the principal ornament in the room a beautifully soft portrait in oils of Prince William of Orange, to whom some interest was attached for us, from his frequent visits to this country. Most of the halls and passages are of marble, and the principal corridor hung with little picturegems, illustrative of that natural mellowed style which is the characteristic beauty of\n",

The grand portal ovei\"shadows the memorials of a history full of poetry and romance, in the monument and tomb of Quentin Matsj^s blacksmith, who, to win the love of a painter's daughter, became one of the greatest artists of whom Flanders can boast. A fantastic fountain adjoining is said to have been wrought by him without the aid of hammer or tile. There is an impressiveness of feeling, natural to entering for the first time .one of those magnificent temples, which have been supposed to msjiire the devotions of Europe's largest proportion of worshippers, for many centuries. This influence was deepened on the occasion of our first morning visit, by the contrast of exchanging the bright early sunshine of the Place Verte, gay with flower and fruit markets under its pleasant lime trees, for the \" dim religious light\" of the shadowy interior. On entering, I was both impressed and disappointed. The devout aspect of the congregation, ladies with gilt prayer books, and cushioned prie-dieux, poor old women kneeling on the steps of some side shi-ine, and young market girls prostrate before the Virgin's picture, with their baskets beside them,—all alike absorbed in devotion, with bent heads, lowered eyelids, moving li])s.and fingers^ busy with their beads, made a touching scene. But my admiration was qualified with wonder at the taste that makes such a clief-d'ceuvre of Gothic art.the mere casket Jifty* containing thdjj^ worthless ornaments, for which the princij Dal reverence of the worshippers seems reserved. In this respect there was a striking incongruity between the noble architecture of the cathedral, and the conspicuous painted cross, wax figure of the Virgin dressed out in tarnished finery, artificial wreaths of flowers, garlands of ribbons and lighted candles which deck the grand altar. Such garish contrasts I afterwards observed ably remonstrated against, in Paul's Letters to his Kinsfolk. Antwerp is a city of churches, whose wonders might fill volumes. St Jacques alone contains more beauties than could be compressed within the limits of a moderate description. Its carvings, pictures, and general ornaments are of rare value and interest, including a magnificent altar of black and white marble, which is esteemed Quellyn's masterpiece; and over the beautifully carved oak pews, we remarked more than one English name and coat-of-arms. A similar interest attaches to the monument erected in memory of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her portrait by Vandyke, in the church of St Andrew, which also contains one of Verbnjggen's beautiful carved pulpits, on the calling of the apostle. The high altar in St Augustine's church is designed by Rubens, whose grand genius is everywhere prominent;—his statue in bronze on the Place Verte, his pew, tomb, and extraor-\n",

Our own peculiar national appreciation of the distinction conferred upon Scotland in the person of our hereditarily great and personally honoured countryman, the heir of Macallum More, promises to find expression in divers forms, of the most appropriate of which would surely be an offering to the royal bride from the daughters of the land of her adoption, and the proposed national gift of a royal residence in our noble capital, such as would afford opportunity for the i-estoration, in some measure, of its by-gone glories as the ancient seat of Scottish royalty. The foundation stone of a most valuable addition to the architectural institutions of Edinburgh was laid, in October, by the Prince of Wales, with full masonic honours. The claims of the Royal Infirmary are so undisputed, and its efiiciency so worthy a medical school unsurpassed in the world, that regi-et must be felt at the acrimonious disputes that preceded the settlement of the new site; but, unfortunately, such difierences seem necessary preliminaries to the adoption of anything new in our city, whatever it may be. Even now, the inhabitants are doomed to suffer all the painful inconveniences attendant upon a scarcity of water, while the Town Council indulge their controversial proclivities in determining the rival merits of the Heriot, Talla, and St Mary's Loch schemes ; and, notwithstanding the increased water rates levied from suburbs growing in every direction, no new supplies are forthcoming to replenish exhausted reservoirs, and fill empty cisterns, a state of things that indeed woos diseases to poor homes, and is sufficient to introduce into the town such fever epidemics as have lately prevailed in Glasgow and Liverpool. Happily, the Association for improving the Condition of the Poor continues its praiseworthy efibrts with the success due to wise philanthropy and excellent organization. In addition to the continuance of soup kitchens as an agency for the prevention of starvation among the very poor in sevei'e weather, dinners are again provided, this winter, for the physical nourishment of those juvenile starvelings of society, whose moral and intellectual training is the real educational question of the day. Under the new Provisional Order, Edinburgh has lately received from its Merchant Company the endowment of a new group of schools, where first-rate education is provided in all branches, at a rate which previous experience teaches us to consider a very low one, with the additional inducement and impetus to study\n",

I would be loth indeed to say or to insinuate that high intellectual gifts are always, or often, unaccompanied by the nobler qualities which render friendship precious. How many bright examples to the contrary rise before me as I write ! But what I would most earnestly deprecate is the feeling, gradually growing stronger in this high-pressure and utilitarian age, the feeling of contempt for the man whose abilities are poor, no matter what his qualities may be ; the constant exaltation of head over heart; the preference, the subservience, the worship accorded to men of high intellect, even when that is their only claim to our respect; and the scornful pity too often extended to men who, in all points save that of mental power, are as high above those who scorn them as the stars are above the earth. But I am becoming much more serious than I ever intended to be. Let us look at the thing in another aspect, and see how tlie high culture of the age affects \" the stupid gii'l,\" or rather, as we generally hear her called on platforms and in pamphlets, \" the silly girl.\" Poor thing, what a life she does lead now-a-days ! Born with capacities which, twenty or thirty years ago, would have been considered perfectly satisfactory, she has worked her way respectably, if not brilliantly, through her school-room days, won the good-will of her governesses, and finds herself at last at what she has been looking forward to as the goal of her labours, her eighteenth birthday. How joyfully she takes leave of books, and slates, and dictionaries, and version-books, and cold, ugly class-rooms, and uncomfortable school-room chairs; how she revels in the bright prospect opening before her of liberty, and amusement, and enjoyment, after the routine and hard work of school-room life. How delightful to think that now she may read, or write, or sew, or practise when and where she pleases; that her evenings may be spent in the family circle, and not in the study racking her brains over next day's lessons; that she will have time now to help Papa with his letters, and Mamma with her housekeeping and shopping, and go with her brothers to the promenades and the exhibition, and dress her little sisters' dolls in every new fashion that appears. Visions of balls and parties, pic-nics and archery meetings, visits to Uncle James in London, and to Aunt Mary in the country, float through her mind; and she falls asleep on her birth-day night planning her dress\n",

And so it is, poor \" silly girl !\" You are born a quarter of a century too late; the pleasures that sufficed your mother and grandmother are now called frivolous and absurd, if not downright sinful; the ti'aining that made them beloved wives and honoured mothers is denounced as \"vicious,\" \"degrading,\" and \" unfit for reasonable beings;\" a different style is to be tried with you. You will be set to study logic and philosophy and mathematics,—no matter whether you understand them or not, no matter that they fill you with weariness and detestation—you will be forced to listen to lectures utterly beyond your comprehension, and study pamphlets till your head aches in trying to discover their drift. Think no more of the balls and assemblies you had promised yourself; if you name such things to your fellow-students, they will turn on you a stony stare of horror, a smile of cool contempt, or possibly a severe reproof. Your brothers will pursue their amusements alone, or with friends more at leisure than yourself; your father and mother must get throiigh their work by themselves, and not interfere with your mental development; little Mary and Bessie must throw away their dolls, and get rid of their childhood as fast as possible. Your kind old friends, your mother's friends perhaps, must be neglected now, for \" calls are a mere waste of time;\" and let your mother do your plain sewing, a high authority has pronounced sewing a badge of woman's degradation. As to your dress, what does it matter what you wear? the more ungraceful, inartistic, and odd, the better it will please your intellectual companions. Don't be afraid to express your opinion on any subject, no matter how new to you ; you will soon learn to contradict an M.D. upon a question of medical treatment, a lawyer upon a point of law, and the Moderator of the General Assembly upon a question of theology, for, of all the sciences, theology is now-a-days the easiest to acquire, the great point, the only thing absolutely necessary, is to beware of orthodoxy ; let your views be heretical, and they are sure to be popular. Alas, poor silly girl, with your simple dreams of life's duties and pleasures, how much you have to learn and to unlearn ! how many a bitter lesson is before you ! Hardest of all, perhaps—most difficult of belief, most bitter if belief is learned— is the lesson which will be set before you early in your new course of study,—the lesson that men are not, as you have believed, and have been so happy in believing, yoiir guides, protectors, defenders against the world; but your rivals, your natural enemies, your tyrants and oppressors.

Have we not read them, quaint, affected, trying above all things to astonish and catch the attention their resources are too weak to arrest by noble means ? Then let the public be told, that because less restrained in choice of subjects and expression than greater men, they are more wide and earnest; because more turbid and obscure, they are deeper and grander, and they become the very plagues of literature. Here, for instance, is a short . extract from a long review of D. G. Rossetti's poems in a book called Our Livmg Poets. Of a ballad called \" Sister Helen,\" the critic writes :—\" I know of no such intensity in any ballad—nor does any other composition of the class arrive at the same dazzling height of finish, or superlative manipulation of burden. No one verse is less thoughtful than the weightiest, none less comely than the fairest; not one line can be dispensed with, and not one word rings a tone higher or lower than the tone of flawless things rung on the counter of the whole soul's judgment. It is the poem in which Rossetti has placed himself most unmistakably beyond the reach of detraction—the achievement I would call to witness—of splendour, of great poetry,\"—and so on, for many pages. If we turn eagerly to this masterpiece, we read a story, told in hysterical, jerky lines, of an impossible crime, utterly ignoble in sentiment, and with some weighty words lugged into a meaningless chorus :— 1. ^ \" Why did you melt your waxen man, Sister Helen, To-day is the third since you began, The time was long, yet the time ran, Little brother.\" Chorus.—\" O mother, Mary mother, Three days to-day, between hell and heaven.\" 4. \" O the waxen knave was plump to-day, Sister Helen, How like dead folk he has dropped away, Nay, now, of the dead ? What can you say, Little brother.\" Repeat cJiorus.

'• My dear Mrs Glynne, I am very glad—we did not know joxi had already returned. I hope the girls \"—Here I was stopped by Mrs Glynne's expression. She sat down beside me on the sofa, looking first at me, then round the room, and then asked hurriedly for Una. I apologised for her absence. \" Oh well, my dear Miss F—Mary, I mean, I rather wished to see you alone. It is no use my pretending, you see, that I've come on a very pleasant errand. You have more influence with Violet than anyone else, and I do so want yoii to speak to her. Indeed there is no time to lose. Since she has taken this resolution, I have had no peace. What is to be done 1\" I gathered by degrees that Violet felt a vocation to join a sisterhood at Wemborough, indeed, she insisted on doing so as soon as arrangements could be made about it, \" If it was Rose, I should have thought nothing of it,\" said poor Mrs Glynne, \" she wovild have taken another whim as soon as she found the life wasn't all roses, and confectionery and gold crucifixes; but Vi is so set on it, and you know she never cared for amusements like other girls, and now nothing will serve her but what she calls a \"religious\" life, as if one couldn't be religious except among those old nuns. I saw through the convent once, and such a set, such faces and figures, their vocation was to keep out of sight as much as possible, certainly. But Violet \" Here Mrs Glynne stopped, and fairly put her lace-edged handkerchief to her honest grey eyes. I was very much distressed, for I liked Violet Glynne, and had never thought her High Church propensities would have led her so far. \"I am much grieved,\" I said, \"but, dear Mrs Glynne, there are others who would be more likely to influence Violet,—Mr Haslam, Mr Brookes, Mr Cyril.\" Mrs Glynne shook her head vehemently. \" Mr Haslam is a good man, if ever there was one,\" she said (I am picking up the H's she dropped in her excitement, and putting them in where they ought to have been), \" but you know, dear Mary, he is not a High Churchman, he is Evangelical rather, and Vi has never gone to his church ; nothing he could say would make any difference. And Mr Brookes, I'm sure, will just say, ' let her follow her vocation.' And Mr Cyril—mark my words, Mr Cyril has put all this nonsense into her head, I'm convinced of it. I knew how it would be—that is, I didn't know how far it would go, of course, but I never trusted that man, casting down his eyes and gliding about like a cat.\" I could not join in her suspicion, for though the Rev.

She doesn't know, of course, that I was coming to see you. I came in the pony carriage, but I'll set you down at the house and then go on to the village. I have some things to order.\" So I got ready, and was deposited at the gate of Glynne Park, walked to the house, and was shown into the drawing-room. Soon after, a light step came to the door, and in walked Violet; such a changed Violet, that I should hardly have recognised her. She had on a grey dress, coarse in material, and utterly plain in make, though it was late in the afternoon, with no ornament of any kind, except a heavy chain of jet beads, and a cross that hung to her waist-belt. Her face had lost all its bright colour, and was white and pinched, with black shadows under the dark eyes ; her hair, no longer frizzled and 2:)uf Fed, was drawn plainly to the back of her head and twisted there ; her hand, when she gave it me, no longer glittered with rubies and diamonds, and was so thin, that I saw the bones at the once round wrist quite plainly. What had changed her so entirely 1 I kissed her, and sat down with the thin little fingers in mine. \" My dear Violet,\" I began, \" how ill you are looking !\" She intermpted me with a hasty impatient motion of her hand. \" No, Mary,\" she said, \"I am well,better than ever I was before. Wouldn't you feel well if you had been in the dark for a long time, and suddenly you saw a light shining in the distance, that seemed to promise peace and happiness 1 That is what I feel now. Everything has been dark for so long, and now that I see rest and peace close at hand, ought I to shut my eyes and say it is dark still 1\" \" My poor child,\" I said, \" I have heard of wandering lights that only betray; are you sure, Violet, it is not one of these you are following, that will lure you into worse darkness, and leave you there 1 You are so changed since you went to London, I should hardly have known you. You are tired with excitement, and so think you are weary of the world.\" \" I don't think it, I know it,\" said Violet; and then suddenly, like the quenching of a lamp, the light died out of her eyes, and she sat down on a low stool beside me, and laid her head upon my knee. \" Oh, Mary,\" she sobbed, \" the world is so bitter, so hollow and poor. I am weary of it, heart and soul; you don't know how weaiy.\"\n",

Don't mistake a disappointment for a vocation, Violet.\" \" A disappointment,\" she said, sharply, \" who said anything of disappointment?\" She tried to look up, and dry her tears—but they came again, the clouds after the rain, heavy and bitter, as from some \" comfortless and hidden well.\" \" Tlie whole world is empty and cold, Mary,\" she said, \" and the more I see of it all, the better I see a woman can't be happy in it. We are made so that all the best of us is turned into pain, sooner or later. Nobody can help it, or mend it; the only way to avoid great sorrow is to go where it is out of the question you can ever be very happy, to give your life to God, and be at rest. That is what I want to do ; to buiy the girl 1 was thi'ee months ago, and forget that she ever lived, and begin a life that has nothing of self in it. Don't hinder me, Mary, or try to hinder me. I have been mad, I do believe, and now it all lies behind me like a dream. Do you remember when we read Faust together 1 there is a line of your translation that runs in my head day and night,— \" Dumb lies the world like the grave.\" —Oh, Mary, I know what that means now.\" She had spoken brokenly, and now she hid her face. Her sorrow touched me nearly, and seemed to diuw us together. \" What is it, Violet,\" I said soon after, apparently a very inappropriate question, but one that I could not help asking, and the answer came most unexpectedly. I was sitting by a small table, with my elbow on its edge, and, in moving, I knocked down a small album that was lying there, and it fell on the floor open, at a place where I saw a dark handsome face I knew well, Louis Maryon's. I stooped to pick up the book, and I saw Violet's eyes rest on the face for a moment with the same hungry eagerness that its eyes had worn when they looked at Una. Poor Violet, I knew how it was, as I put back the book with a sigh, though she thought her look Lad been unobserved. It was cruel to ask her any more ; her secret, I felt sure, was in my keeping, and it was safe. However, she sat motionless and silent, and it was getting late, and the afternoon of sunshine had suddenly darkened over. It was time for me to go home. As I rose, and said I must go now, but would see her next day, and begged her not to do anything without consideration, she looked earnestly at me and said,— \" You guess something, Mary 1\"\n",

And I heard Mrs Glynne go away, and I didn't think you were with her, so that I could go down again in that state ; and I was reading as easily as could be when in walked Brand. How he got in without ringing, or anything I don't know.\" \" It's not the first time,\" said I, nor was it. \" Well, that was your fault, Molly; I never taught him to do that. And I felt so caught, like a bacchante or something of that sort.\" \" Like a mermaid,\" I said. \" I should think Brand would insist on your always having it down, it is very becoming.\" \" And I apologised, and said you were out, and I did not expect any visitors, and thought he was still in town. And then, oh, then, I can't tell you what he said. I never thought he cared for me before, Molly; and now I don't wish for anything else. If he was going to America again I would go with him.\" \"Let us be thankful he is not,\" said I. And then came the gong for dinner, finding Una wildly dishevelled, and me still in my hat of darkness and shoes of swiftness. Love had shaken the glass of Time, and no mistake, and my father the soul of punctuality. I expected a message to hurry us, but none came ; and then Una remembered Papa was going to dine with Mr Haslam, and had told her so in the distant ages \" before Brand came in.\" The front door opened while we were sitting after dinner, Una coiled up on a low ottoman, and I in my old place beside the work table, and a quick step came through the hall. And ere a man had power to say \" behold,\" there was Brand again. \" The bad shilling, Mary,\" he said, \" nous revenous toujours to Lawrence Lodge.\" I rose up gladly to welcome him, more warmly than ever before : such perfect content and satisfaction were stamped on his face. While I shook hands with him, Una seized the opportunity, the room being rather dark, to glide out of it, and was gone before Brand could turn round where she had been sitting in the shadow. \" Dear Brand,\" I said, \" I am so glad of this news. You have been like a brother to me for a good while, and I could not have wished a better one.\" Brand lifted my hand to his lips, very much as his father might have done, and asked in the same breath for Papa and Una. \" Papa will not be home till late, I think. Una, where are you 1\" No answer. I went up-stairs and into Una's room ; all was dark and silent, but for the rushing of the rain which had not yet ceased ; but I presently heard a little rustle, and there was my child on her old perch at the window-sill.\n",

Cl upon the aged father, his Bible upon his knee ; upon the old mother, softly laving the brow and neck of her dying son; upon the sister, gazing out upon the beyond,—we feel, with a certain sense of incompleteness, that there is an absence in their expression and in their demeanour, of that awful, soul-subduing sense of the presence of the mighty king of terrors, soon to pass out from that stricken household with the spirit of the dying man. Perhaps we ask too much from the painter, when we look for this subtle something, this consciousness of an unseen power; the expression of the sorrowing relatives is simply that of decent gravity and subdued feeling, but were a higher, deeper feeling evoked by the hand of the painter, we should hail it as the highest triumph of art. This is, nevertheless, a most pathetic picture. Tlie young wife extended on the couch, her face hidden from view; the faithful collie, his rough, loving head laid between the rigid feet of his dying master ; the poor wounded captive tightly bound, and sitting on the ground with drooping head ; the silent gravity with which the soldiers look on the paiaful scene before them ;—all this makes up a whole, calculated to call out the best sympathies of the spectator; and is manipulated with such skill and unity of design and colouring, as to make a noble picture every way worthy of Mr Herdman's reputation. No. 557, South Octagon, is Mr Douglas's principal picture, \" Wishart preaching against Mariolatry.\" Mr Douglas's taste and knowledge lie in the delineation of mediaeval times. This work is the most ambitious picture we remember having seen from his easel; there is an immense deal of life and spirit in it. The colouring is, however, harsh and unpleasing ; and there is no background to relieve the effect of the throng of listeners crowding and filling up the foreground. The preacher, Wishart, stands upon a raised platform, and with hot intolerance is preaching to the crowd before him ; a Franciscan friar is listening, with hardly suppressed indignation. There is gi'eat diversity of expression and feeling in the listeners, some are amazed and scandalised, others are merely amused. Few among them seem to take to heart the searching words of the preacher ; whose truths, however, w Ul not be allowed to fall to the ground unheeded and unfruitful. In the Sculpture Eoom are two pictures of great merit, by foreign artists. No. 699, \"A Hunting Scene in Spitzbergen,\" by Luder Beckmann. The dying bear and its cubs are truthfully rendered and the accessories are carefully and well filled in. No. 719, \"Queen Mary before her Execution,\" by Gonzalo Salva, is a sufficiently hackneyed theme.

There is nothing striking in this picture, or indicative of much vigour of thought or execution; it is, however, well painted; and there is some life and interest in the group on the right of the queen,—a group of lordly prelates, who, their heads being safe upon their shoulders, can afford, in all the pride of Prelacy and Protestantism, to look upon the sad fate of poor Mary with a mingled feeling of arrogance and cold brutality, which the painter has delineated with great skill. Returning to the Great Room, we have only left ourselves time to notice three small paintings; all, however, showing talent of the highest order. No. 333, \" Touchstone and Audrey,\" by J. Pettie. This is the most complete picture in the Exhibition. It leaves nothing to be desired in its delineation; the artist and the poet are at one, and Shakespeare's famous creation is before us, by the aid of the painter's genius, exactly as the poet expressed it in words. The two figures are standing in a sylvan scene, with the forest of Ardennes in the background. Audrey, in the midst of her sheep, is a perfect rendering of Shakespeare's Audrey. As for Touchstone,—all the world knows Touchstone, and here he is. \"We almost hear them speak. \" Doth my simple features content you, Audrey ?\" says Touchstone, stroking his chin. Audrey,—\" Your features ! Lord warrant us ! what features 1\" No. 361, \" The Signal,\" by the late John Phillip. A Spanish girl drawing back a curtain, and throwing down a rose to her lover. This is a gem; but we need not expatiate on its beauties ; our readers are well acquainted with the works of this great artist, and there is not here much story to tell. No. 297, \"They couldn't say their Canitch,\" by Erskine Nicol. This is the only picture we have from this artist, who grows more chary year by year of sending specimens to his native town. The scene of this picture is placed in the far north. Three boys, admirably painted, are before an old desk, half-chipped away by the penknives of the scholars, in the agonised attempts to get the better of their lessons. These three boys are sti U in the throes of committing their task to memory. The shock-headed boy in the middle begins to see daylight; but as for the other two, the one is struggling with vmconquered difficulties, and the other has passively resigned himself to all the hopelessness of utter despair. This is not a picture of much pretension, but it is worked out with the artist's usual care and characteristic humour.

NEED I say how our old friend, the General, welcomed Una as a daughter indeed 1 and old Grace Sandyside declared they were made for each other, Mr Brand and Miss Undine ? and how for a time all Una's wilfulness seemed lost in the wish to please Brand 1 He had told her all his story, I found, and far from feeling the jealousy that a smaller heart might have experienced, she studied how to make her love heal all the old wound in his heart, so that it should never ache again with the long-past pain. I wondered sometimes how she had contrived to blind herself so long to his affection for her; but her own love had shut her eyes to his, and a revised edition of the story of poor Mary Evans had been imparted to her by that \" little bird,\"—-bird of prey and plunder, which flutters around most places where human beings do congregate. Una never told me who had told her, or what had been told her; but from an expression that escaped her one day I came to this conclusion. Brand was now, of course, a daily guest; none of the total absorption in each other's society, to the exclusion of all other considerations, which marks the conduct of some affianced pairs, was manifest in him and Una; their love seemed to make them more considerate and kind of others, and though Brand, like Lorenzo of old— \" Knew whose gentle hand was on the latch, Before the door had given her to his eyes ;\" and though Una seemed to live in his looks, through those long sweet August days, I never felt myself in the way, and can hardly say I felt jealous of the place Brand had in my darling's heart. I knew he was well worthy to fill it. In all the numerous small cares and pleasures and thoughts connected with Una's engagement, I had almost forgotten the approaching advent of the 11th Hussars. Not so St Michael's in general. Not so the six Miss Screwburys, who bloomed out in all sorts of lovely novelties in the way of costumes and ex ibited a sudden passionate I March.\n",

The distance was certainly a draw-back; but it is wonderful what can be done by energy and perseverance, and twice a week, at least, some of the sisters found their way to Wemborough. So Rose Glynne said, at least, one day when she came to call, alighting from her horse, and rushing in in her habit to embrace and congratulate Una. \" Vi's as bad as ever !\" were nearly her first words, and then I thought, selfreproachfully, that some time had passed since the eventful day when Brand asked C Tna, and that I had never repeated my visit to Violet. \" What's the matter with her, Rose ?\" said Una. \" Oh she's stai-k, staring mad; wants to bury herself alive in a convent, and cut off her hair, and wear a rope round her waist. It is only the natural end to what she has been going on with for a year or two ; but she has worn herself to a shadow !\" and a real shadow of sisterly sorrow came over Rose's own careless face as she spoke, improving it greatly. Una was astonished, as I had said nothing to her about Violet's purpose. But I asked Rose if her sister still persisted in her intention. \" Of course she does. Mamma is distracted, and has cried her eyes out nearly. I can hardly believe Vi really means to go in for that gloomy old grave at Wemborough, and those old witches of sisters. By-the-bye, Mary, T wish you would come over and speak to her, I can do nothing with her, I'm sure, and no more can Mamma.\" Here followed a step in the hall, and Brand came in, whereupon Rose started up to take leave, but I would not let her go so soon, and took her to the book-room, leaving the lovers in possession of the drawing-room. In the book-room we sat down, and I asked Rose what had put a convent life into Violet's head. \" ' I cannot tell, so mot I thrive,'\" quoted Rose, pretending to laugh, but not very successfully. \" I thought it was the Reverend Ambrose, but I met him a week ago, when I was walking, and he asked me if the report about my sister was true. This set me up, of course, as I thought he was the source of all her absurd ideas, and I answered, rather hotly, I'm afraid, that I supposed he know better than any one how true it was, and who had taught her to think that such sacrifices were required of her. He looked quite astonished, and said he should be grieved indeed, if any one could think he had suggested such a step to Miss Glynne, or approved of it in any way. He seemed so much in earnest, that I could'nt help believing him. No, Vi has evolved it out of her own consciousness; there's no mistake about that, but\n",

Oh, you may think I haven't mvich feeling, Mary, because I used to chaflf Vi about her way of going on ; but I'm as wretched about her now as I can be.\" And indeed Rose looked so; but then she began to discourse about Wemborough and the gallant 11th, and told me they had seen a good deal of Captain Maryon in the season, and soon was laughing heartly over the precautions of Miss Wylde, our old governess, who had set up an establishment of her own at St Michael's, and having a holy horror of men in general, and men of war in particular, avoided, with her maiden troop, the road that led to Wemborough, and caused all the blinds on tliat side of the house to be strictly kept down. At length she rose to take leave for the second time, saying she was sure Una and Mr Hilary were wearying for me in the drawing-room ; and having promised to come and see Violet next day, I said good-bye to her. The drawing-room was naturally empty when I returned to it. Brand having taken Una out. That evening was to be spent at the hall; and knowing my two young people would not turn up till five o'clock approached, I went out to take a turn among the pines. I thought as I went of Una, how quickly her sweet young life was drifting into a safe bright haven of home happiness, and, absorbed in such thoughts, I did not observe a tall figure advancing to meet me, till I heard Captain Maryon's voice, and saw him close beside me. I held out my hand with'some hurried words of greeting, and he walked on beside me, talking easily of one thing and another, till at length he said— \" Will you convey my congratulations to your sister 1 I have heard of her engagement ; such news, you know, travels fast. Hilaiy is certainly the luckiest fellow in the world.\" He did not speak hastily, bitterly, as Brand had spoken that day under the beeches. His tone was perfectly quiet and friendly, and yet I distrusted it, as I had distrusted him from the beginning. Could I forget what he had said to Una the last time we saw him ? Bold^ resolute, unscrupulous,—I had read those three words in his face long ago, and I could not help wishing in my secret heart that the corps, whose presence at Wemborough made itself felt in St Michael's, had been sent, to put it mildly, somewhere else. Why not to India, or some other distant clime ? But I gave an appropriate answer to his speech ; and just then, tiirning a corner, we saw two unmistakeable figures before us—Brand and Una, My companion saw them as soon as I did, so there was nothing for it but to go on and overtake them. I noticed they were not walking close together, as was their wont; every\n",

And when we came up to them, and I saw Brand's disturbed face, and Una's little set of the mouth and turn of the neck, my suspicions were confirmed. Brand was startled when he saw his friend, apparently, but shook hands si-ankly and kindly; and Una, I was rather surprised to see, did the same. There was a momentary withdrawal on her part, as if she would merely have bowed, and then, seeming to think better of it, she gave him her hand, hardly raising her eyes to his face while she did so. Then, with a sudden motion, she put her arm through mine. \" I was just getting tired, Molly,\" she said ; \" we will go home together.\" And she led me off, hardly pausing for a parting word with Brand,—not hers, but mine, for I said I hoped we should see him at five as usual; and he also said, \" I hope so,\" glancing at Una, without speaking to her. I felt obliged to extend my invitation to Captain Maryon, but he excused himself; and then I yielded to Una's pressing arm, and we went off. \" What a hurry you are in, child,\" I said, \" and what is the matter ?\" For now I saw how flushed her cheeks were, though it was a cool afternoon, and how her eyes were shining, with a sort of defiant light I had not seen for a long time. \" Surely Brand and you have not quai Telled 1\" Una did not answer for a few minutes, her feet passed swiftly along, treading down the pine-twigs as if with a sense of pleasure. At length she spoke— \" Brand and I are getting to understand each other a little better, Molly, that's all.\" \" It doesn't look like it,\" I responded. \" Oh yes, we understand each other now to perfection. Why, I thought Brand was in love with me, found his pleasure in making me happy, and seeing me so ; and as for Brand, he seems to have thought I was only created for the purpose of doing his pleasure, and having no wish but his. Now we are both undeceived.\" \" What do you mean, Una 1\" I said, wondering what cause of trouble could have come between them. \" If ever a man was in love. Brand is.\" \" I tell you I thought so myself till to-day.\" \" This is some absurd misunderstanding.\" \" Is it t It is an understanding between us,\" said Una. \" I am quite glad you came up when you did, and yet it might have been better if you had not; our understanding would have been clearer.\" \" Tell me what it is all about 1\"\n",

      "The A Uemp L 157 to the honour of human nature, is far commoner than the baser species which only delights to chronicle evil and sorrow. Let me quote the words of an authoress of talent, —\" Gossip has its noble side to it. How can you love your neignboui\" as yourself, and not feel a little curiosity as to how he feres, what he wears, where he goes, and how he takes the great life tragi-comedy, at which you and he are both more than spectators? Show me a person who lives in a country village absolutely without curiosity or interest on these subjects, and 1 will show you a cold, sat oyster, to whom the tide-mud of propriety is the whole existence.\" So surely even citizens of a metropolis need not be ashamed that they feel interested in the affairs of their neighbours, and that they occasionally, nay frequently, enjoy discussing them. Depend upon it, gossip is a good thing ; if only, like other good things, it is partaken of in moderation. It was an immense comfort when I stinnbled upon the above reflections, for though utterly unable to control the impulses of my nature, so far as to refrain from gossip, I was yet possessed by the popular delusion that it was a sinful enjoyment, and indulged in it with many scruples of conscience—which are now scattered to the four winds. There is a delusion—in every sense a popular delusion—■ which affords so keen a pleasure to its victims, and is so thoroughly harmless to boot, that I would never say a word as to its delusive character, did I think there was the slightest chance of convincing anyone thereof— at least as regards themselves. It is the fond idea cherished by the numerous class who cannot buy new clothes whenever they want them, that their old clothes, when dyed, turned, re-trimmed, and otherwise re-modelled and disguised, are believed by the world at large to bo bran new and fashionable articles; while in reality, the world at large, if it notices the garments at all, is not deceived for a moment as to their identity. The curious part of this delusion is, that although we penetrate with the utmost ease into the secret of all the best-devised adaptations of our neighbour's attire, it never occurs to us that our own little subterfuges can possiljly 1)0 detected. We see quite well that Mrs Smith's Easter bonnet is the one she bought last year for Mary's wedding, with maize and black trimmings replacing the pink and white ones ; we all noticed that little Fanny Smith had fallen heir to Mary's striped dress, and that Fanny\n",

They were far too much respected to be merely addressed as \" Puss.\" I have noticed that strangers seemed surprised to see a cat appear when \" Edward\" has been called ; that they looked startled when \" Mrs Jonathan's\" kittens were referred to; and that they smiled somewhat derisively when two other cats were introduced as \" Alice Maud Mary,\" and \" Mr John Bright.\" But we seldom gave these names thoughtlessly, or, as our enemies might express it, \" there was method in our madness.\" Some names were given after certain peculiarities of appearance and character had been observed. Thus one cat was called \" Greedy Jem,\" because of his insatiable appetite; another, \" Patience,\" owing to her meek and subdued expression of countenance, and a third, \" Cinderella,\" from her unwashen look. Being great admirers of the works of Charles Dickens, we have had Mrs Lirriper, Pickwick, Snodgrass, and Winkle among our cat names; and I may mention that Sam Weller, a kitten of tender age, is at the present moment an inmate of our house. We have also had a \" Hodge\" to keep Dr Johnson's pet in remembrance. How delightful, as a bit of grave nonsense, is the story told of this creature. It is related that upon one occasion the doctor was somewhat thoughtlessly praising another cat in the presence of the favourite, when observing his \" countenance to fall,\" he added, \"But Hodge is a very fine cat, sir, a very fine cat.\" My list of names would be scarcely perfect without the mention of Thomas Goodchild, who earned for himself both respect and affection, by his rare amiability and uniform steadiness of conduct. Finding that three meals a day were certain to be provided for them, our cats wasely troubled their heads little about such low pursuits as the catching of rats and mice, but gave themselves up to much sleep and quiet thought. Understanding, however, the importance of healthy exercise, they often took strolls in the garden, or extended thenwalks to the neighbouring woods and fields, where they could study in peace the habits of birds and rabbits.

At length the warning resonance of our \" steam eagle,\" as Mrs Browning would call it, aroused us from our dreams, whether of an imaginative or a shimbering nature, and the glimmering of lights in tall, high-storied houses, announced that we were entering Edinburgh. Passing Arthur's Seat, rising in wild and lonely grandeur above the bustling city, we found omrselves at last upon the soil, for whose independence a Wallace and a Bruce had struggled with such heroic and patriotic ardour; and in a city, around which there hangs such a dark interest, as the scene of one of the most mysterious and tragic dramas ever played out in history, and to which the eyes of historians have been turned with speculative interest and differing opinions ever since Mary Stuart held her court here, and by her unfortunate charms earned the same of a Helen or a Cleopatra. On the way from the station, the effect of the peculiarly high houses, lighted in every storey, was at once novel and brilliant, presenting the appearance of an illumination. It is the custom of families in Edinburgh si-equently to live on flats, something after the manner of pigeons in a cote, but unluckily, the unfortunate inhabitants of the top storey cannot avail themselves of a pigeon's speedy method of exit. When Princes Street broke upon oiuview, the brilliancy of the scene was quite dazzling, with its blaze of lights,— their reflection half-revealing the surrounding beauties of the place from out of the obscurity of night. It is seldom that an after siglit equals the first view of a place, when it bursts upon us with unexpected novelty—for it is almost certain to be precisely the contrary to what we anticipated—and our imagination colours it with a kind of interest that too frequently wears off upon closer acquaintance. Although, when seeing Princes Street by daylight, I was enabled to gain a better and more detailed knowledge of its beauties, yet it hardly came iip to my ideal so much as upon that first rapid coup dtceil; when we felt, rather tlian distinctly saw, the great Castle rock lowering over us like a vast, shadowy phantom, \"\\\\'ith lights like a crown of stars gleaming from its lofty summit; while all around, that, in the glare of day-light, might appear too harshly modern to harmonize with the spirit of the place, was softened in the magic light.

And, finally, the sight loses itself in penetrating into the broad expanse of the Frith of Forth, stretching out into the boundless reach of ocean, or in roving over hill and headland melting away in the purple distance. But, for the sake of truth, it must be confessed that the atmospheric influences before alluded to very frequently condense themselves into a heavy fog, so that a complete view of Edinburgh is a rich and rare enjoyment. Nothing that I saw made a greater impression upon my mind than the first view of Holyrood, obtained from the Calton H Ul one dark and foggy day, when, looming out in the mist, it seemed to be no thing of the present, but rather a ghostly fabric of the past emerging out of the shadowy mists of Auld Lang Syne, only to melt away again and vanish into gloom. The ruined chapel, the antique portal and towers, so historically familiar, so darkly and sternly characteristic of their times, seemed haunted by recollections of dark interest, and associated with the memory of one, \" She, the bright sun of all her sex,\" whose life was a tragic problem which shall not be solved till chivalry, with its warm impulses, and history, with its cold scenting, shall h^ve ceased their struggles here, and when, \" In presence of the countless hosts That have been, are, and are to be,\" the story, not of Mary Stuart only, but of the universe, shall be told and understood. This palace is the very realisation of gloom ; the gloom of history pervades it, the gloom of nature surrounds it, for it stands in silent loneliness, overshadowed by the desolate heights of Arthur's Seat, apart from the noise and confusion of the hurrying world, the tomb of Scotland's buried kingdom, a monument of the days gone by. Where a large mass of humanity congregates together, there must inevitably be a corresponding accumulation of evil, and Edinburgh is no exception to the rule.

Edinburgh is left by the defeat of the St Mary's Loch Bill, which, however, was thought by many an unwise proposal, without any decided scheme,—a defect which should be speedily mended, as the help of all sanitary measures and charitable agencies is needed, to stem the course of the sickness which prevails around us to an almost unprecedented extent. The vaccination mania of last winter has now its value and significance unhappily proved; and the necessity of many sanitary reforms is acknowledged in the common dread of threatening epidemics. A new era in our street travelling was marked by the adoption of the tramway system, which, notwithstanding the recommendations afforded by the cars of superior height, airiness, and smoothness of motion, has already proved itself a dangerous one. It is to be hoped that the better management that comes with time and use will soon do away with all risks. We have to record the loss, during the short twelve months of the past year, of a great historian in George Grote; of a noble warrior and patriot in Sir John Burgoyne ; and of a true friend to both science and literature in Robert Chambers; besides the quenching of the hopeful spirit of the great geographer and geologist, Sir Roderick Murchison, wliile his sanguine expectations of the return of his friend Dr Livingstone are yet imrealised. The present publishing season seems imusually rich. We have new poems from four of the greatest living poets ; another Idyll from Tennyson, an historical drama by Robert Buchanan, two new poems by Browning, and a sacred piece by Longfellow; besides two volumes of Forster's Biography of Charles Dickens, and the beginning of a new novel by George Eliot.

I am sure all, who have any experience of amateiir theatricals, will agree with me that one of the chief points—I might almost say the chief point of the performance—is the dress. It is the one thing which is almost always good; and it is the thing which above all others rivets the attention of a drawingroom audience. Now the \" Game of Romps \" offered a first-rate opportunity for this kind of display. The scene was laid in France, in the middle of the last century ; and visions of hoops, powder, patches, toupees, buckles, rosettes, and clocked stockings swam before our delighted eyes. Moreover, one of the \" persons represented,\" was a Marchioness ! a character subject to an almost endless amount of bedizenment! Clearly the \" Game of Romps \" was a most attractive play. I fear it would be totally uninteresting to the world at large were I to give a detailed account of the plot of this play; and indeed \" plot,\" strictly speaking, it had none nevertheless, it was really a lively little composition, and quite capable of being made, in action, a very amusing performance ; so, without much difficulty, we decided to commit our fortunes to the \" Game of Romps,\" and we all met at Mr Smith's that same afternoon to organise our rehearsals and allot our parts. The dramatis personce were as follows:—A Marchioness, her daughter, her niece, her nephew, her lawyer, her nephew's tutor, her maid, and her daughter's confidential friend ; the Marchioness being thus, as it were, the pivot of the play—the centre round which the other characters revolved in nearer or further proximity. My sister Jane, Avho Avas indisputably the tallest, handsomest, and most dignified of our would-be actresses, was unanimously selected to sustain the part of the Marchioness; and Ave also agreed, without much discussion, to allot the parts of the daughter and the niece to myself and my sister Mary ; and those of the maid and the confidential friend to Katie and Maggie Smith. Then came an argument, long and loud, on the subject of the gentlemen's parts.

The heroines of Shakspeare, for instance, have been criticised, eulogised, \"taken to pieces\" as it were, by divers essayists, till Lady Macbeth, in her mingled strength and weakness, and Rosalind, true and tender, are as familiar to us as the friends of our dailv life. I by no means wish to claim for my imperfect remarks the dignity of a \" review \" on Tennyson ; a duty which has been performed by many hands worthy of the task ; but I would draw attention to some of the femimne characters portrayed by our great Laureate, who assuredly has scarcely been surpassed in this branch of delineation. Many, which I will pass over, are little more than graceful pictures; beautiful, it is true, and drawn with a master's hand, but otherwise possessing no special significance. In this class may be mentioned \" The Gardener's Daughter,\" \" Edith \" (Aylmer's Field), and pre-eminently \" Maud.\" About this last, Uglitly touched as she is, there is a charm almost irresistible, so tender and delicate is the colouring of this perfect portrait; but it is only a portrait. \" Dora,\" though the poem is but a sketch, possesses a more distinct character than those in the other shorter pieces. Her love for her cousin, unspoken, yet none the less true, has a pathos of its own, nowise modified by the simplicity with which the story is told. That love transferred to his child, her meek submission to the old man's anger for that child's sake, are very toiiching, and the last words of the poem have a sad significance :—■ \" As years Went forward, Mary took another mate ; But Dora lived unmarried till her death.\" That touch completes the story. William never loved Dora ; moreover he is dead; but she is loyal still. Mary, who had the treasure for which Dora pined in vain, can bury its memory, and turn from it, nothing loth. Dora loved hopelessly, but the grave of her buried love is green with sacred tears to her life's end. A true story all the world over, but no less sorrowful for that.\n",

The same remark app Hed to Jane {the Marchioness), and she was not so quick as Katie at comprehending the stage \" situations;\" however, she also was remarkably well-suited to her part—could she only remember it. Maggie Smith had learnt her part with the utmost accuracy, and had repeated it, as she assured us, three times over without a mistake, before the rehearsal began ; but she had unfortunately quite omitted to notice her cues, and could only deliver her part as an uninterrupted soliloquy, without any regard to the dialogue of wliich her sentences formed a portion. It was, no doubt, a great triumph of memory over meaning, but not exactly the thing we wanted; so poor Maggie had to resume her studies on a different principle altogether. Mary's little part of the Marchioness'' niece, Blanche, was carefully learned; but she and Maggie both found the difficulties of sitting, standing, and walking on the stage well-nigh insurmountable. The tables and chairs seemed to have entered into a league against them; they could not move without treading on some one's toes; they eluded every efibrt of Mr Jones to keep them away firom the wrong doors, and nothing would induce them to face the audience. The fault of my preparation was just the reverse of Maggie Smith's; her study of the play had been too particular, mine too general. I really felt as if I knew everybody's speeches better than my own, and was with difficulty restrained from appropriating various scraps of dialogue, the rightful property of my cousia Blanche, and my confidential friend Therese. But our acting was absolute perfection, compared to that of Fred Smith and Henry. Fred, who was always rather a puzzle-headed fellow, had apparently studied his part just enough to involve himself in the wildest confusion as to the names and relationships of the different characters. The Marchioness, his aunt; Violet, his cousin and innamorata; Blanche, his sister; and Therese, his and Violess friend ; were all jumbled together in his mind in hopeless disorder, and the havoc he made of their respective identities Avas really terrible.

They must learn to require theiiideals not from, but for those they love, else the falsehood of their extreme will have results more disastrous than those which wait upon the women who are ready to sink all desire for ennobling attributes in their touching faithfulness, (like that of the dog), to the personality of lover and husband. The type of womanhood which has too slight a hold of the ideal gives us daily revelations of pure, unfailing, domestic tenderness, refreshes men with a thousand droppings of the dew from heaven. Such women's placid souls \" can accept momentous doctrines without any eccentric agitation,\" yet they fail to satisfy man's immortal jearnings. Men know their worth, but they hanker after \" Fifines at the Fair.\" Men love them as Fred Vincy loved his easy-goiag mother, but their spirits are neither refined nor at rest in them. In Middlemarch we have all this brought before us very vividly, with the vital exception of the Christ. The only woman who is throughout the book seen to be perfect in her kind, is Mary Garth. She loves Fred Vincy as he is. She would always have loved him and no other, even if he had turned out \" a curate in debt for horse hire and cambric pocket handkerchiess,\" but she loved him also as he ought to be, and never for a moment flinched from her requirement at his hands of his own better self. It was no transceudant requirement. It was simply the requirement of a clear-headed, good-hearted, sensible, moral woman, without a spark of genius, or any aspiration beyond the humble confines of the parish of Tipton. Mary Garth was perfect of her kind, but she was of a kind which belonged to a smaller sphere than the more finely touched spirit of Dorothea. The difference between man and woman is wonderfully shown in the different results upon Lydgate and Dorothea in their trials. They both, under the influence of \" that moral stupidity in which we are all born,\" had taken \" the world as an udder to feed their supreme selves.\" Lydgate, with \" the selfish imselfishness of man,\" again to quote Janus' pamphlet, \" thinks of himself first, of his will and his aims ; he thinks of the woman next, and how these may affect her.

TEANSLATED FROM THE ITALIAN. WE have a great misfortune to lament. At Naples, on the 29th of November, died Mary Somerville, quietly and peacefully, with no previous illness, approaching her 93rd year. Her investigations in astronomy, mathematics, and physical sciences, were not only clear and profound, but almost unique. In her, our Society loses one of its greatest and most illustrious ornaments; science a follower so remarkable and eminent, as to awaken admiration rather than excite hope of emulation. She was born at Jedburgh, in the county of Roxburgh, the 26th of December 1780, of an old illustrious Scotch family. Her parents were Admiral Sir W. G. Fairfax and Margaret Charters. She was brought up at a school in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh ; married, while yet young, Captain Greig, Russian Consul, by whom she had one son. Left early a widow, she married, after some years, her cousin Dr Somerville, by whom she had three daughters. Two only, Martha and Mary, survive to mourn the grievous loss, having been the comfort of her hfe by their affectionate and attentive care, and having received lier last breath yielded up in their arms amid words of blessing and of love. Almost as a child she showed her singular disposition for physics and mathematics, and ingeniously found opportunities of cultivating it, by being present at her brother's lessons on geometry; and while she seemed absorbed in some feminine work, she followed actively and attentively in her own mind the solution of the various problems. When she met with difficulties, she used her father's nautical books to clear them up, for an explanation she dared not ask, as those were times, especially in Scotland, when it was thought almost unbecoming for a woman to take an interest in literature or science. Not only had she no help or encouragement, but opposition and obstacles were placed in the way of her cultivating those sciences in which, self-taught, she attained to such eminence that it has been said of her, justly and truly, \" however difficult Auore T 1873. 2 F\n",

      "The Attempt. 363 It was Sunday morning,—a bright and breezy September day; and the fine old Carillion was ringing, Mary, Joseph, and George, as the bells were called, whose voices were known and loved far out at sea. How often had Raoul heard them in his mind, as now in truth. While avoiding the main thoroughfare, he sped up the narrow lanes, past flowery hedges and scattered cottages towards the massive grey church, which stood alone in a grassy valley, somewhat retired from the little town that lay between it and the sea. And, down the little turfy hill, he could see Gabrielle coming the straight way from the farm. Her freshest bloom seemed glowing in her cheeks again ; her dark velvet bodice, poin^ c V Alencon cap, and rich gold ornaments, were most becoming, as she hastened to him with a bright smile and outstretched hands. \" This morning I thought it was all a dream again,\" she said, \" the dream of your return I have awakened from so often; but it is true—true, and the sunshine of the old days has returned.\" •' And I grew nervous when you were out of my sight,\" said Raoul. \" Of cjurse this must not last, we must have a word with the cur6 before mass; as to the contract, it was all drawn out ten years ago, and only wants dating and signing. We are too busy to wait; I am a consulting surgeon, you know, and you have Leon de Frajou and little Gabriel to look after at once.\" An hour later they had left the church, and were walking arm in arm down the Grande Rue, which was thronged with people, all endlmanche, and most excited by the great news of the night before. So many congratulations and marvellous questions about the Siren were pressed upon the doctor, that he felt some explanation to be necessary, so he turned at the door of the Colonel's lodging, lifted his hat, and thanked the neighbours warmly; and then continued,—\" That I am here again I owe to Colonel de Frajou, who found out where I was and how I had been deceived. It is true that I was detained two years a prisoner in Algeria; but I should not, after that, have remained eight years in America, had I not had false information that Mademoiselle Gabrielle was married. She allows me, however, to say now that she soon will be ; and I have to ask pardon f ir taking her away. But I have no rancour against our Siren; she holds her cup of pure water to all comers ; is\n",

      "The Attempt. 31 Yet another fair flower of our own nurture has been plucked in this garden of Italy. Mrs Mary Somerville's life furnishes a triumphant vindication of the capacity of the feminine mind for scientific achievement, and her death closes a career of industry in which time-honoured womanly employments were not ignored in the presence of learned avocations. Neither did the distinguished lady's strength of understanding and power of genius obscure the womanly elegance of her mind and amiability of disposition, so that her life and character must be considered remarkable. Our obituary closes with the name of a lady who, like Mrs Somerville, has lived to a good age as the ornament of a distinguished circle of English society, and the wife of one of the greatest statesmen of the age. So much has been said of the virtues and graces of Lady Beaconsfield that it is unnecessary further to magnify them here, unless it be to say that the womanly devotion with which she repaid the chivalrous worship of her husband (too rare a thing now-a-days in such perfect development) seems to us the brightest ornament of her character. Edinburgh has lately had the honour of welcoming quite a galaxy of distinguised visitors. A special interest attached to the visit of the Ex-Empress of the French, not only from the magnitude of that royal lady's misfortunes, but from the resolute magnaminity with which she has supported them. Of other foreign royalties, including the Queen of Holland, and a Prince and Princess of the triumphant house of Hohenzollern, the Burmese and Japanese Embassies were specially honoured as the intelligent bearers back to the east of a message of western civilization. A visit so prized as Her Majesty's first stay in our capital since her widowhood, was necessarily made the occasion of signal ebullitions of royalty, the credit of which, however, can hardly be claimed by the citizens as occurring at a date when the inhabitants are generally out of town, and our city is taken possession of by admiring tourists. The warmth of the reception afforded to the Prince and Princess of Wales, evinced such a continuance of the feeling so spontaneously expressed during the dark days of last December, as rendered it matter of some disappointment, that the privacy of the royal visit was so strictly preserved as to avoid all demonstrations of loyalty.\n",

      "The Attempt. 37 impart to the creatures of his imagination an imperishable individual existence, by wielding the instrument of language with Shakespearean strength and skill. Those who are bound in the thraldom of the narrow conventionality of the day, do suffer from queasiness because of the absence of modern English refinement in the fresh, vigorous Scotch ; but even so are some people blinded to the beam of Shakespeare's greatness, in searching out the mote of his occasional derelictions in word morality. Happily, such small exceptions can no more affect the immortal greatness of our Scottish than of our English Shakespeare; the imperishable enunciations of each will live as long as the languages in which they are written; and Hamlet and Tam o' Shanter's \" familiar household words \" of wisdom will be embalmed with classic honours in the mind and memory of society, reading or non-reading. With all his remarkable power of language, wealth of words, and masterly expression, the vein of Byron's poetry is not rich as Burns' in pithy, terse expressions of homely wisdom, keen observation, gentle philosophy, or fervid sentiment. The reason may be found in the supremacy of Burns as a lyric poet, which involves singular happiness of expression. As a song-writer, he has been equalled by very few poets in the world, and certainly surpassed by none. He touches the chords of joy and woe with the hand of a master; and humour, pathos, love, friendship, patriotism, independence are wrung out with alternate force and tenderness, kindling the imagination and rousing the heart. In these immortal effusions, Burns uses poetry as the key to the human heart, a sanctum of which Byron has not the entree; and, so long as poetry is a thing of the heart, intellectual genius must bow to that which sways the soul of man with the resistless potency of a governing motive power. If we but reflect for a moment on the manner in which our two poets treated the standard subjects of lyric inspiration, we must become convinced of the superior greatness of him who sang as he felt with his warm heart, over that of his mighty successor, whose poetic vision was that of the gigantic intellect. First, there is love, the theme of all poetry since the world began. Both poets were therein much exercised and not always happily so. Both were crossed in the purest affection cherished by either, for the \" Mary\" who was in each case, the pure impersonation of his womanly ideal. How\n",

Far off in the centuries as that grief is, it stands recorded in such bm-ning words that, as we read them, the old sorrow moves us yet; so long healed, we may beheve, so lost in the joy of the future, so salutary in its influence on the survivor, yet so intensely bitter that it has given words for the saddest moments of human life. The sonnet marking real joy in his ideal love, beginning,— Si lungamente m' ha tenuto Amore, E costumato alia sua signoria, Che si com' egli m' era forte in pria Cosi mi sta soave ora nel core, was never finished. There is an abrupt break, and the words follow,—\" Quo modo sedet sola civitis plena populo! facta est quasi vidua domiua gentium. I was still occupied witla this poem when the Lord God of Justice called my most gracious lady to Himself, that she might be glorious under the banner of the most blessed Queen Mary, whose name was greatly reverenced by the holy Beatrice.\" After his eyes were wearied with weeping, he wrote Avhat he calls a poor little widowed poem, so beautiful, that it is unfair to give extracts, though one will be found heading the chapter. In another quaint poem, entitled the 9tli of June, 1290 (the day Beatrice died), he expresses, with great force, the more weary and irritating aspect of affliction, which is felt at times replacing a tenderer, nobler grief. Sorrow comes, and says she will stay with him, and ushers in sickness and grief for company. \" Go forth,\" he says in vain; she stops arguing; Love now enters all in mourning raiment; Dante, certainly out of temper, demands, \" What ails thee trifler ? \" and he replies, \" A grief to be gone through, for our own lady is dying, brother dear.\" The desire to find no comforter but Death, who makes all soi Tow brief, seems to inspne others of Dante's touching poems. In one he says,— \" Whatever while the thought comes over me That I may not again Behold that lady whom I mourn for now, About my heart my mind brings constantly So much of extreme pain That I say, soul of mine, why tarriest thou ? Truly the angu'sh soul, that we must bow Beneath, until we win out of this life Gives me full oft a fear that trembleth, So that I call on Death, Even as on sleep one calleth after strife.\n",

This may partly be caused by some large inferior pictures occupying important places, and distracting attention from numbers of meritorious little landscapes and pretty bits of genre. In noticing the pictures, however, we find a few prominent ones, that stand out from the rest, and at once command our admiration. \" Oskold and the Elle Maidens,\" Sir J. Noel Paton's only contribution, is perhaps the more interesting from being about the only picture of the ideal or higher imaginative school this year, the Exhibition consisting almost wholly of genre pictures, landscapes, and portraits, with a very small sprinkling of historical subjects. And in this picture there is a wonderful beauty, which we think can hardly be fairly realised in the crowd and light of its present situation. It needs isolation, and even looking at it through a tube brings out much more of its latent loveliness. How spiritual are the faces of the maidens, even through the disappointed fury of those the knight has left behind him, and the deceitful sweetness of those who still hope to bar his way. Wonderful is the prismatic play of elfish light round the floating figures, contrasting so wildly with the calm of the fading twilight, beyond the great old trees.

Pity 'tis, that in the world are so many of such fair-seeming exteriors that have no heart within, no worship but of self We would almost say that it was a strange providence to have given Rosamond to Lydgate, had it not evidently been tlie providence of the bo.tk that men and women should not marry the being others would have chosen for them, but the being that needed them most. This is expressed in words when Fred Vincy tells Mary that \" Farebrotlier would have made her ten times a better husband than he could,\" and Mary answers serenely, \" Of course he would, and so he can better afford to do without me.\" Middlemarch specially shows that marriage is not the end of life, but the beginning of a new life, which can never more be simple and independent. The element of complexity may have varying proportions, according to the consistency of the partners, but there always must be a resolution of forces, a reconsideration of the aims of life, a modification of its hopes, for \" character is not cut in marble, it is not something solid and unalterable. It is something living and changing, and may become diseased as our bodies do.\" No doubt ]Mr Casaubon's character even was changed by his marriage, which he did not find so entirely charming as might have been expected, considering what Dorothea was. What a grand nature was hers! a St Theresa, a Romola,—strong, self-devoted, single-minded, even to peculiarity, faithful to all duty to the last. How should we wonder that the strange course of circumstances should have led Will Ladislaw to love her, and to be ennobled so by his love, that his better self Avas ahvays chosen for her sake, till he made himself worthy of his love 1 There is a strange pathos in his interview with Bulstrode, where he scorned to touch the money that he thought unclean; where he strove to keep free of stains in connection, but \"he found a stain he could not help,\" and adds, \"it ought to lie with a man's self that he is a gentleman.\" And when this woman, worshipped afar off, descended from her pedestal, gave up rank and riches to share his life and bless it, even his heart, so long kept hungering after love and home, and rest and peace, must have been satisfied. \" Dorothea herself had no dreams of being praised above other women, feeling that there Avas always somethingbetter which she might have done, if she only had been\n",

Still, she never repented that she had given up position and fortune to marry Will Ladislaw, and he would have held it the greatest shame as well as sorrow to him if she had repented. They were bound to each other by a love stronger than any impulses that could have named it. No life would have been possible to Dorothea which was not filled with emotion, and she had now a life filled also with a beneficent activity, which she had not the doubtful pain of discovering and marking out for herself.\" It was a wise touch, this reduction of her fortune, for it satisfied Will's pride, and occupied her in '* learning what everything costs.\" As powerful for good, though in a different way, was the influence of Mary Garth over Fred Vincy, both before and after marriage. One example of a marriage of two equable tempers, and delightfully agreeable commonplace dispositions, is given us in the happy union of Ce Ha and Sir James Chettam. With the lady's uncle and guardian, that characteristic Mr Brooke, I can only conclude, saying,—\" I have had ideas, you know, about all that sort of thing; but ideas are troublesome, and when one has gone mto a thing, it is rather hard sometimes to get out; one can say too much, you know.\" Lu TEA KESEDA. ^\\\\t 1 aun11?d |iOfhs.

The excellence of these poems grew gradually, like all earthly things, from the merely elegant poems of Erek and Iwein, to the original and deeply thoughtful epic of Sir Percival, and the rich poetic imagery of Tristan and Isolt. The poets who succeeded the authors of these productions were unfit for a flight of imagination equal to theirs, and contented themselves either with bare narrations, like those of the poets who had preceded Ilartmann and Gottfried, or with imitations of the latter, vastly inferior to the originals. And so this knightly poetry, like many other things before and after it, had its gradual rise, its day of glory, and then, by degrees, its dechne. 4. LEGENDS OP THE SAINTS AND DIDACTIC POEMS. The life of the Virgin Mary, in three books, was composed by Wernher, a monk at the Tegernsce, in the year 1173. It possesses the stiff character of the old epics, and has likewise in many passages much grandeur and simplicity. The Golden Forge, by Konrad von Wiirzbrug, is one of the best productions of that poet. He represents himself to be a smith, employed in making ornaments of gold and precious stones, to be worn by the Virgin Mary. After showing in a series of hyperboles the difficulty of sufficiently praising the Virgin Mary, he enlarges iipon the purity, humility', and eternal glory of the mother of God. For two centuries this poem remained the admiration and the model of all who directed their efforts towards the same subject. Two other remarkable legends are from the pen of Conrad von Wiirzbrug; one is that of Saint Sylvester, the Pope at Rome, who, to vindicate tlie Christian religion, restored to life a wild bull which had been struck dead by the head of the Jewish Church, and thus led Helena, the mother of Constautine. to adopt the Christian rehgion. The other is that of Saint Alexius, which, though full of exaggerated sentiment and popish superstition, has an interest peculiarly its own. Alexius, the son of a wealthy Koman, was mamed to a noble lady, named Adriatica. At the banquet succeedhig the wedding, the easily extinguished flame of a candle suggested to his mind the transitory nature of earthly things ; and rising from the table, he drew the wedding-ring from his finger, returned it to his bride, and departed.

The old Celts took refuge in the hills and upland farms, where their descendants to thi3 day are found, \" a simple, primitive, intensely superstitious but kindly people, marrying amongst tliemselves, and keeping aloof from other races.\" As a rule, the Manxmen of the present day are fair, tall, and strong. There is one small village, lying south of Port St. Mary, perched high on the hill, approached only by a road evidently seldom used for traffic, where the people are dark eyed, swarthy skinned, altogether a complete contrast to the brown haired, blue eyed Manxman. Near this isolated hamlet rises a bold rocky headland, Spanish Head by name, \" one of the ocean gravestones of the wrecked Armada,\" and the dark inhabitants of the little village on the cliff will tell you that they are the descendants of those who escaped from some of the stranded vessels of the defeated Spanish fleet. They, like the Celts, keep aloof from those around them, avoiding marriage out of their own circle. \"The l\\Ianx are,\" says Bishop Wilson, \" an orderly, civilised people, and courteous enough to strangers; if they have been otherwise represented, it has been by those who knew them not.\" Farming is the chief occupation of the upper classes ; and of late years, tinder good management, nearly all the waste and moorland has been reclaimed, and now yields fine crops, like the rest of the well-tilled lands. The Manx farmers were once very averse to innovations, but the Scotchmen who have settled in the island have shown them how to cultivate their lands to better advantage, improve their breeds of cattle and sheep, and save useless outlay in the way of labour by tlie introduction of machinery. Living surrounded by the ocean, and having the blood of the Norse sea kings still tingling so freely in their veins, it is no wonder that the greater part of the Manx turn fishermen. The lower class of the population trust mainly to the herring fishery for their winter food; and a bad herring season is to them what a bad harvest is to an agricultural people. So much depends on the fishing that, in the reading of the litany in the churches cf the island, after the words,—\" That it may please Thee to give and preserve to our use the kindly fruits of the earth,\" they add, \" and restore and continue to us the OCTOBEE 1871. \" T\n",

Another feature of Scottish character, is personal attachment to the sovereign or chief of the clan ; of the English, intense love of home, and these feelings seem also illustrated by song, in the popularity for more than a hundred years of Jacobite poems, and of such clannish ones as •' The Campbells are coming;\" whilst those that pre-eminently rouse and soothe the Englishman, are the \" Home, sweet Home\" of the peasant, the \"Dulce, dulce, domum\" of the schoolboy. These are only specimens of many characteristics that might be named. Sometimes the nation has not produced the man, who can weave with his magic shuttle the entangled threads of thought into the beautiful and lasting M^eb of poetry, and she finds in another land the fabric she is wanting,— she brings it home, and uses it as her own. And the historian may consider it as such; its foreign origin is the accident of exigency, its national adoption is the voice of the people. Comparing, again, national life with individual, we may say the mythical element, the stories of giants and fauies, marks the childhood of a people,—the sentimental, sanguine, and passionate, its youth,—the historical, the philosophical, the didactic, its manhood,—the complaining, the wearied, the morbid, its old age,—and the return to nursery stories, its second childhood. Applying this to the popular poetry of the present day, we hesitate whether we should place that of England in manhood, or in old age. Tennyson and Browning, with some others, make us hope the former, but there is a school rising of croaking, dissatisfied spuits, the \" Idle singers of an empty day,\" that makes us fear the querulousness of senility may be creeping over the country, and contracts painfully with the manly words of the American poet, \" Let us then be up and doing, With a heart for any fate, Still achieving, still pursuing. Learn to labour and to wait.\" The tendency also to reproduce and to copy (this is different to enquiring into) the myths of early ages, is not the tendency that reassures us in a nation that we trust\n",

A pig may poke his nose into the trough, and think o' nothing outside it; but if you've got a man's heart and soul in you, you can't be easy a-making your own bed, an' leaving the rest to lie on the stones.\" With all this Saxon ethical feeling, Adam Bede was a true Saxon in his relation to woman; watchful to his grumbling old mother; respectful to Mary Burge ; loving, Avith the timid reverence of a first love, the beautiful face that enchanted him; worshipping, with the deep love of a sympathetic soul, the woman he trusted and believed in, and yet found true, \" Beauty has an expression beyond and far above the one woman's soul that it clothes, as the words of genius have a wider meaning than the thought that prompted them : it is more than a woman's love that moves us in a woman's eyes,-—it seems to be some far-off mighty love that has come near us, and made speech for itself there; the rounded neck, the dimpled arm, move us by something more than their prettiness—by their close kinship with all that we have known of tenderness and peace. The noblest nature sees most of this impersorial expression in beauty, and for this reason the noblest nature is often the most blinded to the character of the one woman's soul that the beauty clothes.\" \"And good Adam had no fine words into which he could put his feeling for Hetty: he could not disguise mystery in this way with the appearance of knowledge; he called his love frankly a mystery, as you have heard him. He only knew that the sight and memory of her moved him deeply, touching the spring of all love and tenderness, all faith and courage within him. How could he imagine narrowness, selfishness, hardness in herl He created the mind he believed in out of his own, which was large, unselfish, tender.\" How his true nature suffered, but out of his truth how a light arose, a hope and a better love than the old—for it was no dream of his own, but had an objective reality to justify it. There is no doubt that Dinah brought him a deeper sympathy and an enlarged being. \"And it's a feeling as gives you a sort o' liberty, as if you could walk more fearless, when you've more trust in another than y'have in yourself I've always been thinking I knew better than them as belonged to me. and that's a poor sort o' life, when vou can't look\n",

      "80 The Attempt. was Dinah alone that in her cell moved her to confession, and touched her with the first sense of personal responsibihty. Yet even then her material nature clung to the tangible friend, and her darkened soul cried rather to Dinah's spirit than to the Judge and Father of both, that stood in the Unseen beside her, waiting for her voice. Painful as is her ending, it is almost well that she died free before her friends saw her. Oh ! the shock they would have felt. The round, girlish cheeks, changed by the years and the toil into haggard hollows; the peachbloom gone, the hair thin, and perhaps grey, and the great lustrous eyes left without the sunlight of hope and youth, like sunless tarns amid bare craggy rocks. And how they would have haunted them and followed them, for, let them be as kind as ever they would, she could not have been spared pain. Like one restored from the grave, she would find no place vacant for her. We must not miss that good-looking woman, Mrs Poyser, not more than eight-and-thirty, of fair complexion, sandy hair, well-shapen, hght-footed, with a suggestive family likeness to Dinah, that might have reminded a painter of Mai'tha and Mary. It is amusing to hear her pleading with her niece to stay with her, bringing forward a list of earthly woes that cannot be avoided without her,—\" All because you've got notions i' your head about religion, more nor what's i' the Catechism and the Prayer-book.\" \" But not more than what's in the Bible, aunt,\" said Dinah, \" Yes, and the Bible too, for that matter,\" Mrs Poyser rejoined, rather sharply; \" else why shouldn't them as kno Avs best what's in the Bible—the parsons and people as have got nothing to do but learn it—do the same as you do ? But for the matter of that, if everybody was to do like you, the world must come to a stand-still; for if everybody tried to do without house and home, and with poor eating and drinking, and was allays talking as we must despise the things o' the world, as you say, I would like to know where the pick o' the stock and the corn, and the best new milk cheeses 'ud have to go.\" \" If you loved your neighbour no better nor you do yourself, Dinah, it is little enough you'd do for him.\" Forced at last to underrate herself, to try a last appeal to Dinah, she says she might stay with an aunt \" who was none so good, but she might stand bettering.\" Her racy remarks scattered through the book\n",

      "88 THE ATTEMPT kindliness when translated into the English synonymes, “ pretty” and “ child 1 ” It is indeed impossible to translate into adequate English some of the finest Scotch expressions, such as the beautiful words “Auld lang syne,” which can only be rendered literally by the awkward term, “ Old long ago; ” and the fine beginning to the immortal patriotic song, “ Scots wha hae,” which when expressed by the English words “ Scots who have,” has a most ludicrously commonplace sound. Indeed, the songs and poems of Eobert Burns are full of genuine Scotch forms of language, which defy all attempts to translate them into any other tongue, and which derive not a little of their beauty from the pithy dialect in which they are written. Among the many properties which Scotch possesses, the broad humour which every native of Scotland who enjoys sun must surely thoroughly relish, and that true and tender pathos which we often find inhabiting the same mind, are perhaps, the most distinguishable. Most of us can recollect how we have enjoyed the merry tale of one who, by the comically expressive Scotch words with which he or she interspersed the narrative, imparted a vivacity and interest to the incident, which would otherwise have been wanting; and who that has read the sweet songs of “ Highland Mary ” and my “ My Nannie’s awa,” will deny that, as a means of expressing the tender emotions of the human heart, Scotch is a tongue possessing singular richness ? To our refined ears the broad accent which properly belongs to Scotch, is its least agreeable property, but in reality this cannot seriously be urged as an objection, for in German, which certainly is no vulgar tongue, the vowel “ a, ” as for example in the substantive “ mann, ” the equivalent of our English “ man, ” is pronounced with a fulness of sound which in the Scottish dialect would at once be stigmatized as uncouth and vulgar; while the guttural “ ch, ” which our neighbours across the border find such a stumbling-block, is one of the most striking peculiarities of the German language. While thus standing up in defence of the ancient language of our country, it is certainly not our intention to advocate the return of the natives of the northern part of this island to the use of an almost obsolete tongue, a course which would be by no means desirable, even if it were practicable, which the constant and increasing intercourse of the Scotch with the English would eflectually prevent. But it is yet sincerely to be hoped that the Scottish peasantry may long retain their national dialect, and never suffer it to be exchanged for the odious Cockney jargon, which is equally removed from pure English, without possessing any of those beauties which are still so deservedly admired in Scotch. Far may the day be distant when the genuine Scotch language, that poured from the lips of the heroes and heroines of Sir Walter Scott’s immortal tales, shall be no longer understood, and only read as a means of exercising the faculties\n",

      "218 THE ATTEMPT eccentric young English artist, who lived like a hermit, shunning even the abodes of men. His pictures, however, were greatly admired, and he was compelled to suffer visitors in his studio. He changed his name to Gray—a common enough one in Scotland, and by that means hoped to avoid being recognized. Thus two years passed. He neither heard from his home nor of Alice, and was beginning to get contented and happy with his solitary life, although fears, as to whether he had acted wisely, in so quickly doubting his Alice’s truth, would sometimes force themselves upon him. His forte lay in figure painting; and being at that time engaged on a large piece representing “ Mary Stuart’s last look of France,” he, unconsciously to himself, till he saw the figure completed, had given to the unfortunate Queen of Scotland, every feature and expression of his lost Alice. He felt half inclined to efface it, and paint it over again, but, somehow, looking at the likeness soothed and pleased him, and he resolved to retain it, and paint another for exhibition. One day, some time after, as he was busily engaged on the new picture, the old woman who prepared his meals, and was indeed his factotum, opened his studio door, and announced Sir Edward and Lady Howard. Charles, as usual, was scarcely civil, but the openhearted young Englishman seemed not to notice his host’s surliness, and his fair young bride asked so many questions, and seemed so pleased with any information he condescended to give, that by degrees his reserve disappeared, and he found himself laughing and talking as he had not done since he left Scotland. They examined and praised all his paintings, and were just leaving the studio, when her ladyship’s eye caught sight of a picture with its face to the wall, which, before Charles could prevent her, she had turned, and was gazing on with delight. Her husband joined her, and at once exclaimed, “ Why Emily, that is as like our village school-mistress as if she had sat for it; but I forgot ” (with a fond look at his young wife), “ you have not yet seen your new home and all its beauties.” They were on their wedding tour, and Sir Edward’s estate was situated in the north of England. He turned to question the artist, but forbore, when he saw the deadly paleness of his face, and the haughty coldness of his manner. His wife was not so observant, for she turned laughingly from the picture, saying, “ Ah, Mr Gray, I feel sure there is a story connected with that face, and you must tell it me, to make me look pleasant, when I am sitting for that tiresome picture Sir Edward has set his heart upon; so adieu till to-morrow, and then for the tale.” Ladybird.\n",

E. C. W. ^ ®0ttr on tl}t fathmit. Part I. At seven o’clock p.m. on the 28th of September 186-, the* steam-packet Osborne set sail from Leith for Eotterdam, carrying with her, amongst her other passengers, Dr Blackburn, his wife, and sister Mary. They had a very pleasant sail for an hour or two, but soon the wind increased, and most of the passengers were reluctantly obliged to retire from the deck. Next day the sea was again calm, and continued so during the rest of their short voyage of four days. When they arrived at the Goree or Bar, at the mouth of the canal, they had to lie a few hours, as the water was too low for them to pass. It was night before they entered the canal; and next day there was another stoppage, as the man who had charge of a sluice would not permit them to pass till it suited him. This leisurely mode of travelling afforded them ample opportunity to view the surrounding country. Far as the eye could reach was seen a vast plain, bounded only by the horizon, on which many fine black and white cattle were grazing. Eeeds grew abundantly along the edges of the canal, and were allowed to remain undisturbed, in order to prevent the banks being washed away. When they had passed the Helvoetsluys, they entered and sailed up the Ehine towards Eotterdam, which they reached at one o’clock p.m. As they sailed up the river, they passed several towns, the best known of which was Schiedam, noted for its gin. Now that they had reached the port, Dr Blackburn assisted his charges on shore, and conducted them to a hotel. As they passed through the town they were quite surprised at the strange appearance every thing presented. In every direction there\n",

Many years before our story opens, an Italian nobleman and his family came to reside in Edinburgh, at the earnest solicitation of bis wife, who was a Scotchwoman by birth. On his arrival in Scotland he dropped his title, and took the name of Campbell, which had been his wife’s. He was immensely wealthy, proud of his noble descent, and of a haughty and overbearing disposition to all, save his wife and only child, upon whom he doated with a love almost akin to worship. They lived in strict retirement at their country seat, a few miles from Edinburgh, satisfied with each other’s society, their sole care being to rear their boy to be an honour to his illustrious origin, and an adherent of the Koman Catholic faith, of which they were both zealous and bigoted supporters. The education of Eeginald was intrusted to an Italian priest, who lived with Mr Campbell, in the capacity of private chaplain, and father confessor to himself, his wife, and such of his retainers as professed the same faith. On attaining the age of nineteen, Reginald grew weary of the monotony of the quiet country life he had hitherto led, and expressed a strong wish to enter the army. To this his parents offered no objection—indeed, his mother strongly urged him to join the Royalists, who were then endeavouring to suppress the cause of the Stuarts, which had been gaining ground under the popular leadership of Prince Charles Edward. He accordingly joined the Duke of Cumberland, and had the glory of distinguishing himself most honourably at Culloden, that field so fatal to “ Bonnie Prince Charlie,” but which, so happily for the country, ended the rebellion in Scotland. Reginald Campbell returned to Edinburgh after this victory, just in time to receive the parting blessing of both his parents, who died within a few weeks of each other. He felt their loss very keenly, and for a time was inconsolable; but he was young, and life, with all its pleasures, lay before him, so, need we wonder that when other interests sprung up around him, he thought of them only with a sacred and a sad regret! He was left the heir to a princely fortune, the only condition to his enjoyment of it being, that if he did not marry a Roman Catholic lady, all his wealth was to go to the endowment of a convent. He soon, however, set all doubts aside, by marrying the Lady Mary, eldest daughter of the Duke of Hamilton. This marriage was a brief but happy one, for before two years of wedded bliss had passed, Mr Campbell was a widower, with twin children, a boy and girl, left to his care to rear and educate !

How often had Raoul heard them in his mind, as now in truth. While avoiding the main thoroughfare, he sped up the narrow lanes, past flowery hedges and scattered cottages towards the massive grey church, which stood alone in a grassy valley, somewhat retired from the little town that lay between it and the sea. And, down the little turfy hill, he could see Gabrielle coming the straight way from the farm. Her freshest bloom seemed glowing in her cheeks again ; her dark velvet bodice, poin^ c V Alencon cap, and rich gold ornaments, were most becoming, as she hastened to him with a bright smile and outstretched hands. \" This morning I thought it was all a dream again,\" she said, \" the dream of your return I have awakened from so often; but it is true—true, and the sunshine of the old days has returned.\" •' And I grew nervous when you were out of my sight,\" said Raoul. \" Of cjurse this must not last, we must have a word with the cur6 before mass; as to the contract, it was all drawn out ten years ago, and only wants dating and signing. We are too busy to wait; I am a consulting surgeon, you know, and you have Leon de Frajou and little Gabriel to look after at once.\" An hour later they had left the church, and were walking arm in arm down the Grande Rue, which was thronged with people, all endlmanche, and most excited by the great news of the night before. So many congratulations and marvellous questions about the Siren were pressed upon the doctor, that he felt some explanation to be necessary, so he turned at the door of the Colonel's lodging, lifted his hat, and thanked the neighbours warmly; and then continued,—\" That I am here again I owe to Colonel de Frajou, who found out where I was and how I had been deceived. It is true that I was detained two years a prisoner in Algeria; but I should not, after that, have remained eight years in America, had I not had false information that Mademoiselle Gabrielle was married. She allows me, however, to say now that she soon will be ; and I have to ask pardon f ir taking her away. But I have no rancour against our Siren; she holds her cup of pure water to all comers ; is 445\n",

FAK in the Saxon south, I heard Stories of Highland hi Us and streams; And often, in my midnight dreams. My heart's deep fastnesses were stirred By pictured visions of some wild strath. Some awful gorge, or black ravine. Or whispering rivulet, dimly seen By banks of glorious purple heath. Or, deep in some still, solemn glen, A dark loch, lying lone and sad, Whose silent shores but seldom tread The busy feet of curious men. Or, crowned with cloud-wreaths, towering grand Above the pines that sway beneath, Some hill-peak, motionless as death, Standing a sentry o'er the land. All these, and more, were pictured grand In thought by day, in dreams by night; And fancy cast a halo bright O'er all that glorious northern land. But never, in my dreams most rare Of glen, or loch, or broomy brae, 2 H 207\n",

Fruticosus), and Strawberry {Fragaria Vised), among edible fruits ; whilst of flowers, we have the Cinquefoils, the creeping one (^Potentilla lieptens), the Strawberry leaved (Folentilla Fragariastrum), bearing such a striking resemblance to the Wood Strawberry, that they are not unfrequently mistaken for each other during the period of blossom ; the fruits present a marked difference, that of the Strawberry consists of numerous small tints in a succulent or fleshy receptacle, whilst in the Potentilla, and their close allies the Tormentils and Avens, the seed is dry. Tlie prettiest of the Potentillas is the Silverweed (P. A7iserina), so called from the white silvery appearance of the underside of the leaves; the flowers are large, pale yellow, very fragrant, and lying so close to the ground that they are \" half hidden by the leaf of grey.\" We fear we shall not be successful in finding any specimens of the Spiridae or Meadow Sweet thus early in the summer; but surely we are all familiar with the graceful and fragrant Queen of the Meadow, which delights to fringe the banks of streams and ponds ; the stem attains the height of three or even four feet, the leaves are largo and downy on the under side, the whitish or rather cream-coloured flowers are small but very numerous on much branclied stalks. The scent of the Meadow Sweet is so exceedingly powerful, containing so much Prussic Acid, that we cannot advise any large quantity of it finding place in our bouquet; only in the open-air amid fresh country breezes is it safe to inhale its si-agrance I The small gi-een flowers without petals of the Lady's Mantle (Alchemilla), luxuriating on hilly pastures, the long yellow spikes of the Common Agrimony [Jgrimonia Eupatoria), on waste places, and the Salad Burnet (Foterium Sanguisorha), with its deeply cut leaves smelling strongly of cucumber, and heads of a dark i-od colour, all to be found during this and the succeeding month, fully represent the Sanguisorbese. Of the Rose, the true glory of the family, we need not speak ; all love and appreciate its richness, beauty, and fragrance, whether as revealed in-the opening bud, the fullblown flower, or the fading petals, for \" E'en when it dies, It bequeathes a charm to sweeten death.\" The two principal species of Wild Boses are the Dog Bose [R. Canvna), and the Eglantine or Sweet Briar [R. Rubiginosa.) We must now pass on to the considei-ation of the very important order which yet remains to be noticed,—the Leguininosse.
